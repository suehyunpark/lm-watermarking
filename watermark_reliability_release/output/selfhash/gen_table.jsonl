But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts.

And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson.

{"idx": 3, "truncated_input": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years.

If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov.

That headquarters is expected to bring at least 25,000 jobs, just like the Crystal City campus.\nThe incentive agreement for the second headquarters would give Amazon a tax break on Virginia taxable income for 15 years, but only if it occupies 500,000 square feet of office space in the county.\nBoth agreements were approved in a Board vote Dec. 14.

{"idx": 10, "truncated_input": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of", "baseline_completion": "toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail\u2014that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey. A bricks-and-mortar nation turns its lonely eyes to you.", "orig_sample_length": 1499, "prompt_length": 1299, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "toothpaste is not the Product that gets someone off his or her couch, but a great website or app is.\nMaking sure that Walmart's Product is on point, cohesive and well designed, and its brand is cohesive and well designed, is a task that requires a specialist. In hiring Casey, Walmart has made a step in the right direction. It is now up to Valerie to ensure that the Product Management discipline is firmly implanted inside Walmart and that the brand is elevated and that the experience of its products and services are cohesive, delightful and unified.\nWalmart will no longer be a retailer, but a great Product.\nWithout a Product Manager, it is just an assortment of products sold in a box.", "w_wm_output": "toothpaste, a roll of toilet paper, a bar of soap, a frozen burrito or a carton of eggs are just the Products that a person uses. What's important though is the collective experience that a person has when she or he uses them and the subsequent expectations that those products will have on her or his future purchases and experiences.\nThe challenge for Walmart is not how it differentiates itself in the brick-and-mortar space, but how it differentiates itself in the e-commerce space. As Bezos knew, the Product is the only true competitive advantage a business has. It's the only thing a business has direct control over.

Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland. There was \u201csome follow-up\u201d and it was assigned to a detective who was \u201cworking to build a case against our suspect at that time,\u201d Brophy said.

{"idx": 12, "truncated_input": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located", "baseline_completion": "in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.", "orig_sample_length": 1658, "prompt_length": 1458, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "in /drivers/video/v4l2 now include support for the VC4 graphics core from Vivante Corp. (1, 2). The VC4 graphics core is used in the new Tegra 4 SoC, which was presented at CES 2013 and will be used in the new Nexus 7 tablet that Google will present at the Google IO developer conference next week. Another driver for V4L2 devices, the radeonhd driver, supports the VC4 graphics core at least with regard to the XvMC codec, which lets developers use the hardware to decode videos with the VP8 and VP9 codecs. The requirements for a VC4 graphics core to be used with XvMC are similar to those for the VC2 graphics core used in the Tegra 3 SoC.\nThe kernel now includes support for the AMD Radeon HD 7", "w_wm_output": "in the /sys/kernel/sound/v4l2_input directory now have a \"name\" parameter.

Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the", "baseline_completion": "next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency.

We don't know what the trigger was for the last eruption.

{"idx": 14, "truncated_input": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A", "baseline_completion": "couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.", "orig_sample_length": 1445, "prompt_length": 1245, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "helmet is your most important piece of safety gear for an electric motorcycle road trip.\n7) The best motorcycle road in America is the Dragon, but it's hard to find a place to stay there, so you might want to camp overnight.\n8) Nissan's level 2 chargers are plentiful on the East Coast, but CHAdeMO DC fast chargers are only available at a few dealerships in California.\n9) My favorite electric-vehicle charging stations are Cracker Barrel restaurants.\n10) The fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n11) Electric motorcycles", "w_wm_output": "high-performance motorcycle is a great way to see the world. I've had people approach me at charging stations just to say hello, and when I'm on the road, I meet tons of other riders who stop and chat with me. They've asked a lot of awesome questions about the motorcycle as well as my lifestyle in general.\n7) If you're riding a motorcycle with a sidecar or trailer, charging might not be as simple. Fortunately, as these vehicles become more popular, more charging options become available.\n8) Electric motorcycles are becoming so cool.

{"idx": 19, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery", "baseline_completion": "has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months.

It does not, however, appear to include all the analytics data the company has on you outside of what you\u2019ve shared.\nFor context: While we\u2019d like to think Instagram will let you download your data simply out of the goodness of its heart, there are two major factors contributing to the decision.\nFirst there\u2019s the Cambridge Analytica scandal (I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it by now, but if you need", "baseline_completion": "a recap, our explainer post is here).\nEven if Cambridge Analytica had never happened though, allowing users to download data is an important step for complying with Europe\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

In fact, you can already do so with Facebook.\nDownload it: The feature is available to everyone via the Web now, and is in the process of rolling out to the Android and iOS apps.

It was one of the biggest stories of 2018, and it caused Instagram to scramble to underline its commitment to user privacy. As part of this commitment, Instagram promised that it would eventually let you download your data\u2026 just like Facebook.\nThe second reason is that it had to. Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that companies let people download their data. It\u2019s part of what\u2019s being called the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and it\u2019s been in effect since May 25, 2018.\nIt\u2019s important that you do this.

As a result, lawmakers have started to take a closer look at the company\u2019s business practices and whether they violate the law, and Facebook and its services have been hit with lawsuits.\nThe data download feature is the second part of a settlement Facebook reached in a class-action lawsuit over its controversial use of third-party apps and the user data they received.\nWhat\u2019s the benefit? While the data download is a nice step, the reality is that it\u2019s just a Band-Aid.

In the late 1800s, local children gathered on the hill beside the president\u2019s house to play a game with their colored eggs following the Easter holiday.\nThe White House Easter Egg Roll was of special interest this year. The Trump administration was very late to organize it. Some people who hoped to attend the event were even worried that it would be canceled.\nPolitical observers said the Easter Egg Roll would show how well Trump\u2019s administration could plan and operate a complex public relations event.\nTalk about the event also brought attention to the first lady, whose office usually plans the White House Easter Egg Roll. First Lady Melania Trump has not yet moved to Washington, DC.

Last year, for example, about 36,000 people attended.\nThis year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll also did not include performances by top celebrities or professional athletes. Instead, children were invited to draw pictures for U.S. soldiers.\nThe Easter Bunny made an appearance, though, as did both Trump and the first lady.

{"idx": 26, "truncated_input": "So you might ask yourself, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d How can things be so bad that educators feel the need to petition?\nSuperintendent Michael Hanson\u2019s administration issued a mandate to all school principals, vice principals and counselors to lower the number of suspensions and expulsions districtwide using a repackaged, rhetoric-filled behavioral modification program called Restorative Justice.\nThis Restorative Justice concept is not new. These interventions usually fail under the weight of their overexaggerated promises. This leads to an odd belief that if you decrease the number of official suspensions on paper, you can claim success regarding improved behavior.\nFresno Unified board member Christopher De La Cerda, McLane\u2019s representative, highlighted this delusion when he stated, \u201cThe data confirms that restorative practices at McLane are working as we intended it to work.\u201d Sort of like bragging that no one drowned in the pool after the water was removed.\nIf the intention was for more than 80 percent of the teaching staff to be so fed up they needed to file a petition \u2013 congratulations! Mission accomplished.\nThe saddest part of this debacle is that it has ironically resulted in increased insecurity and systemic violence for our teachers and students who truly want to be educated.\nBut here is the most disappointing fact: This situation did not need to happen; it was self-inflicted.\nThree years ago, there was a wonderful, accredited, academic program in Fresno Unified that took in up to 1,600 secondary students a year, who either could not \u2013 or should not \u2013 attend a traditional high school.\nThis program was a last-chance beacon of hope for thousands of students who, by their own fault or the fault of others, would have had no real chance of graduating from high school. It was called the J.E.Young Academic Center (JEY). It provided an educational sanctuary for the very students FUSD is trying to corral with this Restorative Justice debacle.\nEvery student was treated \u2013 educationally and emotionally \u2013 as a unique individual. JEY accepted the entire spectrum of students; from those whose special needs could not be adequately met, to those whose behaviors could not be adequately accommodated on a traditional high school campus. This program was an oasis for students on the precipice of failure.\nIt was a wonderful independent study program that served the needs of those most in need. Every", "baseline_completion": "body won. But that didn\u2019t matter.\nFor spurious and ego-driven reasons, this program was dismantled and diminished to a mere shell of its former self. It was replaced by a program that failed after two years. Like prisons, it involves removing those in society with unacceptable behaviors and placing them into a concentrated environment of only themselves.\nIf shooting oneself in the foot was considered a good thing, then FUSD could qualify as a world-class marksman regarding this issue. If FUSD really wanted to practice restorative justice, it would bring JEY back to its previous stature. Maybe Larry Powell could help.\nWilliam (Bill) Larkin monitors online credit-recovery classes in the Apex program. He taught in the JEY program for eight years.

However, when the district decided to merge the JEY program with another, it inevitably destroyed the heart and soul of the program. The integrity of the program was destroyed in order to bend to state requirements.\nJEY was not a test-driven, cookie cutter program. It was an institution that truly cared about the individual. It is a sad irony that the \u2018program\u2019 that was designed to take in the most troubled and disenfranchised students, is now the only place where a student can be expelled.\nIf this terrible plan is not reversed, the school board will be responsible for a massive exodus of the very teachers and students it is supposed to be serving.\nThis is not a plan for educators; it is a plan for the \u2018education\u2019 industry.\nPrevious Post Fresno Unified School District Teachers: Take Your Schools", "w_wm_output": "student was provided a laptop computer that was the core of the learning experience.\nStaff was on duty seven days a week. Every student was assigned a teacher who was their mentor and guide. These teachers helped the student to find the most appropriate educational pathway, and assisted them to navigate their educational challenges.\nThe result? Year after year, the percentage of JEY students who completed a High School Equivalency certificate and/or a High School Diploma was at least twice the rate of their counterparts at traditional campuses. These numbers have remained steady even in the face of the current educational fads that have been adopted district-wide.\nNow, the administration seems bent on dissolving the only educational program that was meeting the needs of the most vulnerable students.\nThese wonderful teachers and staff are being targeted for elimination because they did the very thing the FUSD is now demanding: They reduced the number of suspensions.\nIt", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.8103519678115845, 0.803259015083313, 0.9353116750717163, 0.7450706958770752, 0.9667478203773499, 0.7475973963737488, 0.7613020539283752, 0.7979140877723694, 0.9434480667114258, 0.9268713593482971, 0.5311113595962524, 0.6559666395187378, 0.836697518825531, 0.7566145062446594, 0.498529851436615, 0.9082409739494324, 0.9252389669418335, 0.38919010758399963, 0.8435217142105103, 0.9718361496925354, 0.8187898397445679, 0.8455383777618408, 0.3746066093444824, 0.3719627261161804, 0.3518420159816742, 0.7643609642982483, 0.9349461197853088, 0.6796000003814697, 0.6802353858947754, 0.8888522982597351, 0.6113494634628296, 0.8870686888694763, 0.8108725547790527, 0.9005075097084045, 0.9012086391448975, 0.9319444298744202, 0.3525347113609314, 0.7055441737174988, 0.9362805485725403, 0.6813686490058899, 0.9265481233596802, 0.6374273300170898, 0.8814647197723389, 0.8348395824432373, 0.47412508726119995, 0.9404630064964294, 0.9366812705993652, 0.8537057638168335, 0.9271734952926636, 0.6634351015090942, 0.8842707872390747, 0.8175439238548279, 0.7296448945999146, 0.8038684129714966, 0.9274242520332336, 0.91655433177948, 0.36164772510528564, 0.6858989000320435, 0.695281445980072, 0.9462489485740662, 0.7757235765457153, 0.8130820989608765, 0.8499876260757446, 0.35178816318511963, 0.5851938128471375, 0.6499902606010437, 0.9242552518844604, 0.9320990443229675, 0.647608757019043, 0.9382821321487427, 0.4984031915664673, 0.3539940416812897, 0.48561644554138184, 0.8495018482208252, 0.8037393689155579, 0.3582684397697449, 0.5940067768096924, 0.3859243392944336, 0.5549403429031372, 0.6296528577804565, 0.6858475208282471, 0.711682915687561, 0.7998329997062683, 0.35913676023483276, 0.6746622323989868, 0.3676843047142029, 0.35432204604148865, 0.7879514694213867, 0.8094969987869263, 0.833371639251709, 0.3610644042491913, 0.8708264827728271, 0.8204731345176697, 0.3565641939640045, 0.5075198411941528, 0.35164082050323486, 0.35152775049209595, 0.7877476811408997, 0.9234561920166016, 0.6556897163391113, 0.5454732179641724, 0.584940493106842, 0.7978681325912476, 0.4841916561126709, 0.8099437952041626, 0.8062015175819397, 0.3556109368801117, 0.7125239372253418, 0.7564643621444702, 0.5639002323150635, 0.35152459144592285, 0.4512758255004883, 0.7096716165542603, 0.8070894479751587, 0.7792718410491943, 0.6985654830932617, 0.8367324471473694, 0.8121979832649231, 0.8124520778656006, 0.704235315322876, 0.7468551397323608, 0.3532019257545471, 0.9419649243354797, 0.9690386056900024, 0.9714860320091248, 0.9221423864364624, 0.6884112358093262, 0.8102840185165405, 0.8545193672180176, 0.9325562715530396, 0.9560253620147705, 0.6873962879180908, 0.46389225125312805, 0.3532145619392395, 0.49365636706352234, 0.4640417695045471, 0.9318504333496094, 0.7758679389953613, 0.9529632925987244, 0.8952212333679199, 0.7761988639831543, 0.6654930710792542, 0.36904728412628174, 0.9346843957901001, 0.36235761642456055, 0.6516109704971313, 0.7737691402435303, 0.8569166660308838, 0.8159078359603882, 0.6446893811225891, 0.893256664276123, 0.9407009482383728, 0.49052050709724426, 0.6041391491889954, 0.36174476146698, 0.8249384760856628, 0.8007281422615051, 0.8501308560371399, 0.3515699803829193, 0.6806821823120117, 0.6649523377418518, 0.8206562995910645, 0.939300537109375, 0.5543383359909058, 0.7652136087417603, 0.8090759515762329, 0.7453891038894653, 0.7825677394866943, 0.8351724743843079, 0.7948850989341736, 0.939464807510376, 0.3518105745315552, 0.8015655279159546, 0.9175301790237427, 0.3515065312385559, 0.8078882694244385, 0.7563549280166626, 0.8098242282867432, 0.6123586893081665, 0.8107710480690002, 0.629292905330658, 0.7840608954429626, 0.7927430868148804, 0.5193339586257935, 0.3525088131427765, 0.8369424343109131, 0.7901401519775391, 0.8921263217926025, 0.3515937030315399, 0.8210989236831665, 0.7430342435836792, 0.9318267107009888, 0.599614143371582, 0.5441335439682007, 0.35476985573768616, 0.6292333006858826, 0.374666303396225, 0.6403780579566956, 0.7166361808776855, 0.9419233202934265]}
{"idx": 29, "truncated_input": "This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season", "baseline_completion": "along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line game.", "orig_sample_length": 1216, "prompt_length": 1016, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ", he was reported to have remarked, ''This is my last ring.'' Those words were not made public until after he had met with reporters.\nAs for Jordan, he said he hated to see Jackson go, ''but the business of basketball is not always about love and friendship.'' That was said after a previous postseason meeting, when Jordan had heard that Jackson would not return next season.\nSo Krause, who has a contract that runs until 2002, may have to go, too. Maybe.\nThe Bulls have 17 players under contract for next season. Reinsdorf would not say whether he would bring Jackson back as coach for a final year, but indicated that he would not be locked in. He said he would leave that decision to Krause and the Bulls' new general manager, John Paxson, a four-time champion with the Bulls who has only been a general manager for two seasons.\n", "w_wm_output": "'s title in the 1994-95 season, he told the crowd, including a few thousand fans at the United Center, that he had earned the ring 10 times over.\nIt was a statement that may have rankled Jordan, Pippen and the team's executives in the room, and some might have wondered if Krause was talking about himself or the team.\nIt was one more instance of the clashing personalities of a man who was once a good player for the Bulls but who was never a good fit with the team's owner.\nIt was the same with Phil Jackson, who was a good fit with the Bulls' superstar but a bad fit with the Bulls' owner.\nThe Bulls' owner may have had the final word on Jackson, but he had a bad feeling for a long time that it was time to take his name off the door to the locker room after the games",

What did kemo sabe mean? \u2013 boss, or pal, or champion of justice, or paleface idiot?\nWhen I was little, there was no radio in our house; our parents were deaf. Our grandparents had a big table-model Philco in their parlor. Just as kids nowadays tease for an iPhone, I kept asking for a radio until I got it. A tiny, dark-brown Bakelite-cased Arvin, it sat on the sideboard in our dining room.\nEvery weekday, from 4:45 till 6:00 in the afternoon, I pulled my long-legged chair up to the sideboard, turned on the radio, and gazed at the dial. Many of you must remember \"watching the radio\" and memorizing the numbers of the AM dial, from 520 to 1610 kilohertz. I could tell from the glances I got from my parents as I sat there \u2013 sitting still for longer than at any other time in my life \u2013 that they suspected I was listening to something inappropriate and possibly sinful.\nAt 4:45 a voice crackled over a simulated radio transmission: \"CX4 to control tower. CX4 to control tower. Standing by\u2026\" The answer was immediate: \"Control tower to CX4. Wind southeast, ceiling 1200.

When the Lone Ranger walked across the board platform of a railroad station, each of us constructed a different scene. It was like the famous \"driveway moments\" on Public Radio; you could do nothing else demanding thought while you were into an on-air drama. Listening to archived recordings now reveals it to have been pretty simplistic drivel.

I had to endure two hours of listening to the announcer before I finally heard my favorite station \u2013 770 on the dial \u2013 playing a record, and settling back to listen to music, waiting for the next 4:45, when I could turn to the dial and hear Jack Armstrong, the All-American boy.\nmy favorite program.

{"idx": 34, "truncated_input": "No, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself. The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing \u201cthe fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone\u2019s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else\u2019s conduct, the justice of someone else\u2019s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution\u2019s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed king would have been spared instead of going to the chopping block.\nWe know of not a single instance of a self-pardon having been recognized as legitimate. Even the pope does not pardon himself.

He says that the president can act as if he has no conflicts of interest.

In one sense, Trump is right \u2014 he can do all of these things, although there will be legal repercussions if he does. Using official powers for corrupt purposes \u2014 such as impeding or obstructing an investigation \u2014 can constitute a crime.\nBut there is one thing we know that Trump cannot do \u2014 without being a first in all of human history.

For example, they gave Congress the power to declare war, but not the power to declare war against itself.\nIf the president could pardon himself, the impeachment and removal process would be undermined. If the president could pardon himself, his exposure to criminal prosecution would be reduced. And if the president could pardon himself, his ability to use the pardon power to punish or reward his friends and his enemies would be unconstrained.\nSelf-pardoning would also remove any doubt about whether the president can pardon his family members, members of his administration", "w_wm_output": "sins, including that he had disrespected his superiors. It was a gesture to show that no one, Pope or otherwise, is above the law.\nPresidents have asserted the authority to pardon themselves on at least two occasions, each time with the result that the Justice Department advised the president he could not. As a result, President Nixon was pardoned by then-President Gerald Ford without the benefit of a presidential pardon. President Bill Clinton was not pardoned by President George H.W. Bush, as many speculated.\nThe Constitution, the rule of law and basic decency all demand a decisive, clear and unambiguous rejection of a president\u2019s self-pardon authority.\nTrump\u2019s \u2018great and unmatched wisdom\u2019 is a lie.

{"idx": 45, "truncated_input": "After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the", "baseline_completion": "power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms. When used effectively, a first lady's podium serves as a force for change.\nNatalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Women's Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute and co-author of \"A Role Without a Rulebook: The Influence and Leadership of Global First Ladies.\" She wrote this for InsideSources.com.", "orig_sample_length": 765, "prompt_length": 565, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "White House as a platform to rally the nation around shared goals. In the past, first ladies have had access to a range of influential networks, which they have tapped to increase interest in their causes. For example, in 2009, Michelle Obama began the \"Let's Move\" campaign to tackle childhood obesity by engaging the private sector.\nMost recently, during the 2016 election, Trump hosted a forum on mental health. If she becomes a platform for inclusive engagement, she can draw from a range of networks and social capital to leverage momentum toward her goals.\nAs first lady, Donald and Melania Trump will have a unique opportunity to shape the role in ways that reflect their values and priorities. With this report, we hope they'll consider how their predecessors made a difference, and that they'll use their own gifts to improve the lives of all Americans.\n", "w_wm_output": "platform to reach out to people in different fields, including business and philanthropy, and to create a dialogue around the causes she is championing. This approach could have significant benefits \u2014 a recent study found that the primary social networks of presidents have a strong influence on the economic outcomes of their administrations.\n3. Leverage her platform to engage.\nWhile the presidency is the nation's highest office, the first lady's role is a party-neutral, nonpartisan one. This allows her to engage people from a plethora of backgrounds and create a platform for people to join the cause.\nFor example, Michelle Obama leveraged the platform to launch \"Let Girls Learn\" and \"Reach Higher,\" which supported education initiatives and student opportunities for high schoolers across the country.

{"idx": 52, "truncated_input": "Elvis Costello played a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs. And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all them well.\nOver a career of more than 40 years, singer Elvis Costello has been a punk provocateur, a seminal new wave voice, a contemporary pop singer and even a classic crooner. And there have been fans of each of Costello\u2019s career ventures.\nSo how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture \u2013 his very strong new disc \u201cLook Now\u201d?\nOn Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs.\nAnd to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well \u2013 not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs.\nPerhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated.\nEither way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016.\nBacked by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with \u201cThis Year\u2019s Girl\u201d from his 1978 sophomore disc, \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model,\u201d with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound.\nHe followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful \u201cHoney, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,\u201d and \u201cClubland,\u201d with Costello\u2019s \u201870s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a \u201cWatching the Detectives\u201d affect.\nLater offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc\u2019s new single \u201cUnder Lime\u201d had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. \u201cWhy Won\u2019t Heaven Help Me\u201d was pretty rocking. The slow guitar-and-piano \u201cStripping Paper\u201d was a clear reminder or the Elvis of old, and the slow, sensitive \u201cSuspect My Tears\u201d had some of his best vocals of the night, as he reached for a falsetto.\nEarly in the show, the older songs Costello played were nearly all deeper cuts: \u201cNew Lace Sleeves\u201d from 1981\u2019s \u201cTrust\u201d; a rocking, new-wavey \u201c(I Don\u2019t Want to Go To) Chelsea,\u201d with good lead guitar.\nSo that when he did play a hit \u2013 his 1977 U.S. breakthrough \u201cWatching the Detectives,\u201d (in the same darkened-stage presentation as the last time he was at the Sands) it got a huge crowd reaction \u2013 and deservedly so.\nCostello later did the same with later songs: A largely voice-and-acoustic guitar version of 1986\u2019s \u201cIndoor Fireworks\u201d to a big cheer from the crowd, and closed the main set with a faster, more rocking \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d from his last disc, 2013\u2019s \u201cWise Up Ghost\u201d that segued right into the hit \u201cPump It Up,\u201d thumping, urgent and rocking.\nCostello\u2019s encore stretched eight songs and 40 minutes.\nIt opened with one of the night\u2019s best: a barely instrumented, mostly a cappella \u201cAllison,\u201d with his two female backup singers. It got a huge cheer. Then a stark and spare, piano-and-voice \u201cAccidents Will Happen,\u201d on which he reached for a high and powerful end note.\nHe used that same vocal approach on \u201cI Still", "baseline_completion": "Have That Other Girl,\u201d which he also wrote with Bacharach, \u2013 really singing it --and paired that with a new Bacharach co-write, \u201cHe\u2019s Given Me Things,\u201d from the new disc.\nCostello flubbed the start of that song slightly, and after saying \u201cthis is the first night,\u201d re-started it dramatically better.

{"idx": 53, "truncated_input": "BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Fighting in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City killed 23 Iraqis yesterday, hospital officials said, and the U.S. military reported five troop deaths, as April showed signs of becoming the worst month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September.\nAt least 11 of the Iraqi deaths occurred when mortar shells landed in residential neighborhoods. Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.\nOfficials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters.\nThousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said.\nThere were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October.\nHis fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide.\nAlthough U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or \"special groups\" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others.\n\"A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM,\" he told lawmakers in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia.\nCrocker and Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, gave lawmakers their assess", "baseline_completion": "ments of the war during two days of hearings in Washington that ended yesterday.\nThe surge in troop deaths since the Basra offensive has underscored their contention that security gains witnessed in recent months easily could be reversed. At least 30 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since the Basra operation began, most in Baghdad; at least 19 have died in Iraq so far this month, representing the highest daily average since last September.\nThe deaths announced yesterday brought to at least 4,031 the number of U.S. troops to die in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. Brief military statements said three of the soldiers died in roadside bomb blasts: two in northeastern Baghdad and one east of the city. Two others died of \"non-combat\" injuries, statements said, giving no other details.", "orig_sample_length": 931, "prompt_length": 731, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ment of the war in testimony that was sharply critical of the Iraqi government.\n\"We are not making sufficient progress. The situation is not improving,\" Crocker said of the Iraqi government. \"The overall political situation is not improving.\"\nPetraeus said that Iraqi forces were still not ready to take on the \"full weight\" of violence in the country.\nCrocker and Petraeus also said that security in Baghdad has deteriorated in recent months, with attacks up 25 percent over the first three months of the year. April was the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September 2006.\nThe U.S. death toll for April so far is 69, according to an Associated Press count of military announcements.

Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter.\nSean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California.\nThis is not your typical barbershop.\nAnd that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood.\n\"We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,\" says Heywood.\nMR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops.\n\"We're trying to thrive, not just survive,\" Heywood said.\nMR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network.\nThe two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track.\nAmong other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly.\n\"We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,\" Walker says.\nGiving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago.\n\"All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,\" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago.\nImagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area.\nThat was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921.\nBut on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\nSound off: What challenges do black entrepreneurs face?\niReport.com: How would you make black America better?\n\"People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' \" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. \"We evacuated. They were destroying everything.\"\nThe death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials.\nThe riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered.\n\"It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'", "baseline_completion": "d be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,\" says Walker.\nWess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, \"We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box.\"\nHis advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it.\n\"Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,\" Young says.\nWalker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him.\n\"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,\" he says. \"I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1196, "prompt_length": 996, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "re seeing this country's history around the same time period with the Great Depression. These two things came together to really destroy the community,\" Walker says.\n\"When you lose a community, the entire community suffers,\" added Walker. \"And the generations that follow, we're suffering. There's a lot of pain, a lot of anger, a lot of hurt.\"\nThe full recovery of Greenwood is not possible, says historian Tim Madigan, whose book \"Our Oklahoma: Stories, Poems, Essays, and Artwork of the Sooner State\" chronicles the riot and its aftermath.\n\"For me, what's important is that the truth be known, that the nation knows what happened in Tulsa,\" Madigan said.\n\"There's a myth in this country that all black people are struggling and all black people are poor.

He remembers the chaos. His grandfather's business was burned to the ground, but he escaped. He says the destruction was a watershed moment for his family. \"It was very unsettling. We didn't have to worry about going to the other end of town anymore. It was a scary time,\" he says. \"It was a tragic time.

This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4.

{"idx": 60, "truncated_input": "LOS ANGELES \u2013 A lawsuit filed Wednesday against ABC (search) and \"American Idol\" judge Simon Cowell (search) alleges they conspired to steal the brand and concept of \"Million Dollar Idea,\" a series airing in syndication.\nThe suit, filed in federal court by Jean Golden and Todd Walker, the creators and hosts of \"Million Dollar Idea,\" (search) follows ABC&apos;s announcement in July of a new show of the same name that the network said was created by Cowell.\n\"From stem to stern, each and every detail of Simon Cowell and ABC&apos;s mock &apos;Million Dollar Idea&apos; is a patent rip-off of Todd and Jean&apos;s four-year labor of love,\" attorney Pierce O&apos;Donnell alleged in a statement Wednesday.\nThe lawsuit sees to stop ABC from using the name and idea and calls for unspecified damages. O&apos;Donnell predicted they would reach into \"the tens of millions of dollars.\"\nA call seeking comment from Cowell was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\"We have not even been served with the complaint in this matter, and so have no comment,\" said ABC spokeswoman Annie Fort.\nThe suit also names FremantleMedia North America, producer of FOX&apos;s \"American Idol\" and proposed producer of ABC&apos;s \"The Million Dollar Idea.\" (Note the slightly different title.) FremantleMedia does not comment on pending litigation, spokesman Brian Reinert said.\n\"Million Dollar Idea\" first aired on KSTC-TV in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market in 2003. The series was recently syndicated to more than 125 stations nationwide and its creators registered for both copyright and trademark for the show&apos;s name and premise, according to their statement.\nThe show is taped before an audience and judges at the Mall of America. New product inventors and marketers from across the country compete for a prize package to help launch their product and place it for sale with a Mall of America retailer.\nThe syndicated series has received newspaper, magazine and TV coverage, including on NBC&apos;s \"Today\" show, the suit says.\n\"It is incredibly ironic that our show, the premise of which is to promote, protect and reward small-town American ingenuity, was itself the victim of corporate theft and gre", "baseline_completion": "ed,\" Golden said.\nHer partner, Walker, pitched a deal for the show to ABC in early 2004 and provided copies of their presentation to CAA, according to the suit. That&apos;s the same agency identified in a recent ABC press release as having \"packaged\" \"The Million Dollar Idea\" with Cowell.\nBesides the alleged theft of the title, every major concept connected to the show also was copied, the suit claims.\nIn the July 13 news release announcing \"The Million Dollar Idea,\" ABC described the series as \"a nationwide search for America&apos;s greatest entrepreneur with the best business idea or new product,\" with the prize to be $1 million \"worth of business support,\" including cash and other resources.\nThe idea was conceived by Cowell and British entrepreneur Peter Jones, according to the ABC release.", "orig_sample_length": 790, "prompt_length": 590, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ed,\" the statement says.", "w_wm_output": "ed,\" Golden and Walker said in a statement.\nThe lawsuit comes as \"American Idol\" has become one of the country&apos;s biggest entertainment sensations with a loyal fan base, including Cowell, the notoriously blunt judge. \"American Idol,\" the FOX (search) series, kicked off its fourth season in January and has become a cultural phenomenon with a loyal following.\nIt was revealed in January that Cowell would also have a hand in a new FOX series that had \"American Idol\" host Ryan Seacrest as executive producer. \"American Inventor\" has yet to air, but a FOX spokesman said the \"American Idol\" executive producer would have no involvement in the new show.\nOn the FOX website, \"American Inventor\" is described as a contest where \"inventors dream of being able to introduce a product that will change the world.\"", "no_wm_output_length": 7, "w_wm_output_length": 199, "spike_entropies": [0.3566657304763794, 0.4639931321144104, 0.6880297660827637,

{"idx": 61, "truncated_input": "Are stoners now a target advertising demographic for fast food companies?\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast-food companies have become increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.\nJuly 31, 2012, 1:48 a.m.\nBetween Taco Bell's \"Fourthmeal\" advertisements and Jack in the Box commercials featuring slow-talking stoners, it's hardly a secret anymore that fast-food companies are shamelessly targeting potheads with their ads. But have they crossed a line?\nOnce considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious.\nTake, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the \"late-night munchies.\" Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology.\n\"If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language,\" said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. \"One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned.\"\nIt's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product.\nOf course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose.\nWhether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its \"late-night munchies\" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart", "baseline_completion": "fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin.\nSo long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic.\n\"A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo,\" said Yohn. \"They think it's more effective to be overt. It creates more buzz.

{"idx": 67, "truncated_input": "For professors, publishing in elite journals is an unavoidable part of university life. The grueling process of subjecting work to the up-or-down judgment of credentialed scholarly peers has been a cornerstone of academic culture since at least the mid-20th century.\nNow some humanities scholars have begun to challenge the monopoly that peer review has on admission to career-making journals and, as a consequence, to the charmed circle of tenured academe. They argue that in an era of digital media there is a better way to assess the quality of work. Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.\nThat transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week \u2014 the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. \u201cWe have never done it that way before,\u201d should be academia\u2019s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book \u201cPlanned Obsolescence\u201d on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history \u2014 a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n\u201cKnowledge is not democratic,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, \u201cHow Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.\u201d Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to", "baseline_completion": "a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now \u201centirely won over by the open peer review model.\u201d The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvocates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control \u2014 for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly \u2014 are given short shrift under the current system.\n\u201cThere is an ethical imperative to share information,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it.

She believes that the traditional process of peer review is becoming outmoded, and that scholars should be evaluated not only on publications but also on their participation in the digital community.\n\u201cThis is a pivotal moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe scholarly publishing model is undergoing fundamental change.\u201d", "w_wm_output": "a coveted job. Most humanities jobs require that the candidate have published at least a few articles in prestigious journals like the American Historical Review, the American Historical Association\u2019s flagship publication.\nFor many professors, publishing in elite journals is a rite of passage.\nIn the current issue of Shakespeare Quarterly, for example, both the editors and contributors are professors at top-tier universities. Some have written for the journal before; one received a fellowship at a humanities institute.\nBut this year the quarterly broke with those traditions. The journal asked six graduate students, including two at Harvard, to post their research on the Web as well as on the journal\u2019s pages. Their research was evaluated online by more than 300 people, including a few historians who have also written for the quarterly.\nMs. Rowe, the editor, said that the decision not", "no_wm_output_length": 141, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.7411966919898987, 0.8191932439804077, 0.35154345631599426, 0.35182997584342957, 0.9004328846931458, 0.7900148630142212, 0.938294529914856, 0.9043181538581848, 0.3626250922679901, 0.7891154289245605, 0.7983521223068237, 0.8878692388534546, 0.805541455745697, 0.8023346662521362, 0.663446307182312, 0.7873896360397339, 0.6948676109313965, 0.37296321988105774, 0.5108397603034973, 0.6805424690246582, 0.7133746147155762, 0.5584022998809814, 0.9060339331626892, 0.3516381084918976, 0.3515670597553253, 0.5296634435653687, 0.3515017330646515, 0.6949648261070251, 0.7181241512298584, 0.7774776220321655, 0.37221214175224304, 0.3620085120201111, 0.6573461890220642, 0.7973314523696899, 0.7460541725158691, 0.7452776432037354, 0.5574072599411011, 0.5724145174026489, 0.3516083061695099, 0.823708176612854, 0.3515182137489319, 0.6831424236297607, 0.5665166974067688, 0.762991726398468, 0.9389605522155762, 0.9479883909225464, 0.9182254076004028, 0.3517218232154846, 0.5889063477516174, 0.9244569540023804, 0.574488639831543, 0.7779519557952881, 0.3518839180469513, 0.3712333142757416, 0.3515060245990753, 0.4576681852340698, 0.6085901260375977, 0.9635668992996216, 0.35393965244293213, 0.3622802197933197, 0.36994361877441406, 0.7742470502853394, 0.9098849296569824, 0.8817570209503174, 0.8611788749694824, 0.9465532898902893, 0.8779433965682983, 0.40859320759773254, 0.7206900119781494, 0.3892527222633362, 0.3515593707561493, 0.35152196884155273, 0.44142550230026245, 0.8687177896499634, 0.4865874648094177, 0.3543776869773865, 0.9226372241973877, 0.8217222690582275, 0.9046202898025513, 0.3515922427177429, 0.5905545353889465, 0.7181572914123535, 0.487605482339859, 0.8027803897857666, 0.9524095058441162, 0.351589560508728, 0.7522866725921631, 0.9065955877304077, 0.717147946357727, 0.6299682855606079, 0.35151806473731995, 0.6663845777511597, 0.35151171684265137, 0.7008768320083618, 0.8526557683944702, 0.8884878158569336, 0.8903672099113464, 0.8873094320297241, 0.8349942564964294, 0.8088842034339905, 0.6050522327423096, 0.6655644774436951, 0.8256510496139526, 0.8088557720184326, 0.7138464450836182, 0.9446127414703369, 0.3521615266799927, 0.6562536954879761, 0.5350251197814941, 0.9183663129806519, 0.3558344841003418, 0.5988000631332397, 0.35152071714401245, 0.9244575500488281, 0.7066832780838013, 0.9305738210678101, 0.9359047412872314, 0.957119882106781, 0.7548359632492065, 0.7723591923713684, 0.35175225138664246, 0.9181385040283203, 0.6772969365119934, 0.6163195967674255, 0.7204334139823914, 0.3515265882015228, 0.728685736656189, 0.8755557537078857, 0.8773001432418823, 0.889065682888031, 0.9516724944114685, 0.9032553434371948, 0.3528999090194702, 0.3743104934692383, 0.7945460081100464, 0.9375472664833069, 0.8981096148490906, 0.9077821969985962, 0.8775542974472046, 0.5269328355789185, 0.5295839309692383, 0.8798609972000122, 0.8457596302032471, 0.8781414031982422, 0.8373523950576782, 0.6800241470336914, 0.7485405206680298, 0.6707059144973755, 0.8389517068862915, 0.6289016008377075, 0.8305134177207947, 0.6778864860534668, 0.8858245611190796, 0.4966888427734375, 0.3515283167362213, 0.7687889933586121, 0.5025290846824646, 0.8469542264938354, 0.8453521728515625, 0.8354616761207581, 0.9289357662200928, 0.6072967648506165, 0.7593139410018921, 0.8868270516395569, 0.3643643260002136, 0.45237869024276733, 0.7517684698104858, 0.5354525446891785, 0.8579940795898438, 0.7911779284477234, 0.7115813493728638, 0.8255189061164856, 0.9361227750778198, 0.8886079788208008, 0.910942554473877, 0.35331085324287415, 0.8134017586708069, 0.8616511821746826, 0.7035814523696899, 0.6619365215301514, 0.4201720058917999, 0.41946694254875183, 0.5603258013725281, 0.3517538011074066, 0.5239356756210327, 0.6642849445343018, 0.8855444192886353, 0.4295653700828552, 0.3517169952392578, 0.5207802057266235, 0.351803719997406, 0.6902551651000977, 0.6756394505500793, 0.7314823865890503, 0.5448312759399414, 0.6218602657318115, 0.7038162350654602, 0.8835698366165161, 0.9576708674430847, 0.483938992023468]}

{"idx": 73, "truncated_input": "Meet Google's Robot Army. It's Growing.\nGoogle can't stop buying robotics companies. In the past two months, eight of the 12 companies the search giant has acquired have \"robotics\" in their name or descriptions. Here's your complete breakdown of the robot army presently at Google's command.\nAs stated in the midst of its buying spree, the company's largely letting its new robotics divisions continue to work on their preexisting projects, and why wouldn't they? The newly acquired companies are doing a damn good job. They're even winning competitions.\nRobot technology would help with self-driving cars, certainly, but the range of these acquisitions hints at even broader ambitions. Again, we don't know much. They're all a part of the Google X division, which is top secret by definition. We do know what the new companies in the Google family are up to, though, and that might offer us some clues.\nThese guys are rockstars. The Japanese team that got its start at Tokyo University just took the top prize at DARPA's Robotics Challenge Trial thanks to the cunning and agility of its 5-foot, 5-inch, 209-pound bipedal robot. After being purchased by Google in early December 2013, Schaft's blue machine proved to be the best at walking on uneven terrain, climbing ladders, clearing debris, and connecting hoses, ultimately scoring an impressive 27 out of 32 possible points.\nThe company was originally founded to build disaster response robots after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 but has since broadened its scope, thanks in part to funding from the U.S. government. Who knows how far they'll go floating on Google's coffers?\nIndustrial Perceptions, Inc., is an imaging company that spun off of the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage. Before being acquired by Google in December\u2014the day after the Schaft acquisition, in fact\u2014IPI was focusing on building advanced technology for 3D vision-guided robots to be used in manufacturing and logistics. This includes the ability to see and sort different objects, say, in a factory. You could imagine a company like Amazon being very interested in this kind of technology, but it's so far unclear exactly what Google wants to do with it.\nRedwood Robotics started as a joint venture between Meka Robotics, SRI International, and Willow Garage, IPI's parent. And like IPI, it's always had a very focused mission. Redwood wants to build the \"next generation arm\" for robots. Meka Robotics founder Aaron Edsinger once said that he wants to do for robotic arms what the Apple II did for computers. Specifically, Redwood wants to build robotic arms that can work alongside people even in the comfort of their own home. That also means being the common arm manufacturer of service robots, so in the future, everybody's personal robot could have Redwood arms. Well, make that Google arms.\nLike its cousin, Redwood Robotics, Meka is dedicated to building robots that can live and work with human beings. The company describes its flagship model, the M1 Mobile Manipulator, as having \"human-safe, human-soft, and human scale robot technologies that will enable the robots of tomorrow to work alongside people in the home and the workplace.\" The human-like faces on the robot can even emote, a feature that's as creepy as you let it be.\nEven before joining Google, Holomini was a pretty secretive outfit. All we really know from its now shuttered website is the company describes itself as \"Creators of high-tech wheels for omnidirectional motion.\" The image above is just a stock photo guesstimate of what a \"high-tech wheel for omnidirectional motion\" might look like.\nIf Redwood and IPI are the engineers in the family, Bot & Dolly are the artists. The company describes itself as \"a design and engineering studio that specializes in automation, robotics, and filmmaking\" with a mission \"to advance motion control and automation as a creative medium.\" In reality, this means that Bot and & Dolly use robots to help film commercials and movies like Gravity. This doesn't mean that Google wants to get into the movie business, but hey, if a robot's good enough to make a movie, what else can it do?\nBoston Dynamics is the real celebrity of the bunch. After acquiring six robotics companies in six days, Google took a couple of days off before announcing this major", "baseline_completion": "acquisition. The company is known for building all kinds of futuristic bots from the bipedal, humanoid robot Atlas (above) to the impossibly fast, four-legged Cheetah. Actually, Boston Dynamics brings a whole robot army to Google, one that the military is very eager to recruit.\nGoogle's latest purchase is less interested in building an actual robot than in designing an intelligent robot brain. The self-described \"cutting edge artificial intelligence company\" that uses \"the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms: comes with a team of 75 researchers and software engineers whose talents could be put to use on anything from the hypothetical Googlebot to the company's flagship search engine and anything in between. Because after all, robots are just another step in Google becoming the company that is everywhere, and does everything.", "orig_sample_length": 1272, "prompt_length": 1072, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "purchase. The company is best known for building robotic dogs, but has also recently branched out into robotic rhinos and robotic cheetahs. The company's roots are in the Department of Defense, but its founder, Marc Raibert, has tried to steer the company away from military applications. Google may not be able to resist that pull forever, though.\nYet another robotics company that was founded as a spin-off of Willow Garage, Industrial Perception has since shifted its focus away from robots and towards people. Specifically, the company is working on technology that could one day allow us to control our devices with our minds.\nThis company is so new that it's not even on Google's website yet. But we'll be updating the list as we learn more.", "w_wm_output": ", and well-known, acquisition. Since the 1990s, BD has been building robots that can run, jump and open doors. One of its latest creations is the BigDog, a 6-foot-tall, 340-pound, four-legged robot. Like the Schaft bot, the BD bot proved to be a crowd favorite at DARPA's competition.

{"idx": 74, "truncated_input": "Thorpe of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association says the decision to raise penalties won\u2019t solve the parking crisis.\nFor more than a decade, Ken Thorpe has been a soldier in the fight against parking tickets, which has become part of the escalating war for access to the curb. It's a conflict that has intensified in recent years as ride-hail services have clogged roads, New Yorkers have had more of their purchases delivered, and the streetscape has been remade with bicycle lanes, pedestrian malls and restrictions on parking and unloading.\nThe city \"has whittled away at the commercial parking infrastructure,\" said Thorpe, the chief executive of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association, which he founded in 2004 to deal with parking issues for small and midsize businesses.\nAt the same time, trucks are making more deliveries than ever, and they must do that regardless of whether there's unloading space available. \"Trucking is not a 'choice' situation,\" Thorpe said. \"It's a necessity.\"\nBut now the 600 members of his group, as well as large fleet operators such as UPS and FedEx, are facing higher fines\u2014and possibly more paperwork and time in traffic court\u2014as a little-known yet controversial city policy comes under fire. The stipulated-fine program was established in 2004 by the Department of Finance to let businesses pay slightly reduced fines\u2014and no fines at all for some infractions\u2014in exchange for not contesting their tickets.\nIt was mainly a way to reduce everyone's administrative costs while having delivery companies pay roughly what they would have otherwise. (The reductions were calculated with an eye on the percentage of tickets that were successfully challenged.) But the program was a sore point with advocacy groups such as Transportation Alternatives, which considered it a corporate giveaway that neutered traffic enforcement.\nLast month, in a bid at leveling the playing field for businesses not in the program\u2014and furthering the city's congestion-reduction goals\u2014the Finance Department announced that next month it would raise the program's fines, including those now set at zero.\nAs if that were not bad enough for Thorpe's membership, in the same week five City Council members introduced a bill to abolish the program. They denounced it as a free pass to large corporations and a contributor to reckless parking and congestion.\nThorpe says it's the council bill that's a giveaway\u2014to parking-ticket brokers, who stand to gain business adjudicating tickets. He sees no way that the Finance Department's plan will change driver behavior or have any impact on congestion.\n\"The theory of the program was there are bad things, good things and some things in between, and it taught the driver you're going to pay a lot to do bad things and little or none to do the others,\" Thorpe said. \"Now they've put the bad and good closer together, removing the driver's incentive for doing the good, because it's going to cost just a little more to do the bad.\"\nIn fact, good and bad parking behavior will not be punished that similarly. The most serious violations that get discounts, such as obstructing traffic ($10 off the $115 total), will now get no break at all, while many of the zero-fine infractions will cost $25.\nBut Thorpe says those increases could cost some of his members hundreds of dollars a week\u2014enough that he would consider taking them out of the program. The $35 fine for double parking outside Midtown is still better than the official $115, but he notes that double parking is legal for the first 30 minutes, and enforcement is not always scrupulous.\nIn 2011 he sued the city, which for some years had been slapping double-parked delivery trucks with the more expensive violation of blocking a travel lane, which carried a $40 fine. In 2016 the city settled and paid those covered by the lawsuit $14 million.\nEven so, the Finance Department, which worked with the Department of Transportation on the new fine schedule, says more needs to be done to ease congestion. The agency says the stipulated-fine program has been sending the wrong signal to the wider parking universe by not reflecting the fact that not all double-parking tickets are dismissed.\n\"We need the program to have incentives that are aligned with the city's goals to reduce congestion, and we need the program to be fair,\" said Finance Deputy Commissioner Jeffrey Shear. \"We agree that the conversation about congestion is a larger conversation, and there are many other factors, and this program is one small piece. But we don't want to send the wrong message by saying double parking outside of Midtown will cost businesses nothing.\"\nThe Transportation Department maintains that it is doing all it can.\nThe agency is \"committed to improving commercial accessibility throughout the five boroughs, especially in the context of our street-improvement projects,\" a spokeswoman said. As part of those projects, \"new curb regulations are installed that are complementary to the larger curb-management goals of the corridor, such as faster bus mobility, reduction of double parking, and better commercial access.\"\nBut the Transportation Department is aware that it's a long way from curing congestion when demand for deliveries from myriad e-commerce businesses, including Amazon and Fresh Direct, is bigger than ever.\n\"Consumer demands and the amount of available space we have at the curb, they're at odds right now,\" Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said at a Crain's breakfast forum last month. She added that parking enforcement can only do so much, and larger fixes, including congestion pricing and technology such as license-plate readers, might be part of the answer.\n\"Right now the demand for the curb exceeds the supply,\" she said.\nSome members of the City Council are not convinced that higher fines will make the program more effective. They say any solution will include abolishing stipulated fines.\n\"This program doesn't work,\" said Costa Constantinides, a City Council member from Queens, who introduced the bill to end the program as one of several parking and transportation proposals. \"Trucks are still parking in bike lanes. It's been around for years, and I really feel it's prohibiting us from having a real conversation around parking that we desperately need to have.\"\nAs part of that conversation, the councilman introduced a bill that would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which oversees city agencies, to have buildings under its jurisdiction receive deliveries between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\"The city should lead by example,\" Constantinides said.\nThat's not so simple, it turns out. A Transportation Department off-hours delivery program proved unworkable for many businesses, some of which had to add employees to accept the shipments. The councilman said his program would be \"one part of the puzzle.\"\nAs it happens, parking-ticket broker Glen Bolofsky has contributed more than $4,000 to Constantinides' campaign treasury in the past five years. A spokesman for the councilman dismissed the idea that the bill was intended to help brokers.\n\"The majority of those that benefit from this [stipulated-fine] program are big-box delivery corporations who flout traffic laws at the expense of pedestrians, cyclists and drivers,\" the spokesman said.\nBolofsky agreed that ending the program would help brokers, but he insisted the biggest beneficiary would be the public. \"Congestion will be reduced,\" he said. \"More money will be raised.\"\nAssuming 70% of double-parking tickets are dismissed, he estimated the city has forfeited $147.5 million over the life of the program by not fining participants for double parking beyond Midtown.\nThe new schedule will collect about 30% of double-parking fines, but Bolofsky insists the program still benefits the biggest operators the most. He maintains that neither the city nor companies such as UPS will lose money adjudicating tickets, arguing that many companies still have in-house teams for the job, and automation can reduce the expense further. He noted that the city handled 12 million tickets a year in 1990, when they were handwritten, and had to deal with only 10 million last year. Enforcement agents now use handheld devices that reduce the errors and bad handwriting that led to dismissals.\nThe Finance Department disagrees with his conclusions, saying both the city and the 1,751 companies in the program\u2014encompassing 48,880 vehicles\u2014would spend more without the program.\n\"We would need more hearing officers,\" Shear said. \"The companies would have to retain brokers or hire staff to defend against these parking tickets. In terms of revenue, there would be no increase to the city.\"\nApart from whether the program is good for the city, a walk through Midtown with several UPS executives revealed how difficult following parking rules can be.\nAnother option would be to park at a metered spot a couple of blocks away and cart diamonds by hand truck to recipients, which UPS rules out for security reasons. \"It would put our driver and other people in the area at risk,\" said Axel Carrion, director of state public affairs.\nA few blocks away, on West 50th Street, where commercial parking was allowed at that hour, every space between Sixth and Seventh avenues was taken, mostly by delivery and commercial vehicles. There were two idling for-hire vehicles and three cars with \"parking authorization\" placards\u2014the bane of parking-reform advocates\u2014on their dashboard.\nEven when a UPS driver finds a legal spot, regulations can conflict with the company's efforts to operate efficiently. Using new dispatch-planning technology, the company has increased the number of packages a truck will carry to nearly 400 so that one truck does the work of two. But that truck needs to stay in one place much of the workday, doing pickups when it's done with deliveries. Parking rules\u2014which aim to promote the flow of traffic and keep operators from hogging spots\u2014require it to move after three hours.\nBut circling the block will delay deliveries and the truck could lose the spot, so the driver will stay put. This reduces congestion and pollution. But the ticket, which costs program participants nothing, will set them back $25 under the new schedule.\nOverall UPS expects", "baseline_completion": "its payments under the fine program to jump 32% next year, to $21.8 million, with a $3.4 million increase from double parking and more than $1 million from unloading in the wrong spot or at the wrong time. The company says it would like to try other solutions, such as paying for spots where a truck could sit all day. Long term, it would like to see new building construction include space for unloading.\nRight now the firm is weighing the benefits of staying in the program.\n\"My drivers can be trained to avoid the ticket, and we have drastically reduced the amount of tickets over the past couple of years,\" said Dan Byrnes, director of finance at UPS, adding that the city's ticket data aided his efforts. \"Now with these changes, [the city] is not really helping.

{"idx": 77, "truncated_input": "On April 4, 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft. The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world, and also bag the title for one of the most valuable companies.\nToday, there is a little bit of Microsoft in everybody\u2019s life. Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft\u2019s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company\u2019s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available. Maybe you are into gaming and own an Xbox One, or your company relies on Azure cloud services.\nIn the last 40 years, Microsoft -- which once used to sell program language interpreters -- has expanded into several categories, and now makes full-fledged operating systems for not just desktop computers, but smartphones, gaming consoles, servers, as well as Internet of Things devices. Surface tablets and Xbox consoles show the company\u2019s side interest in developing its own hardware modules.\n\"Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution\", Gates wrote in an email sent to all Microsoft employees yesterday.\n\"In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices\", Gates noted.\n\"Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way\".\nAnd this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn\u2019t released until 2010. By this time, iPhone had showed its dominance in the world, and Google was upping the ante with Android. Windows Phone is still struggling to gain any substantial market share. The mobile platform still has a wide \"app-gap\" problem, though the company seems to have found a couple of ways to fix it.\nBut one of the most exciting things that happened in the company was its decision to open up. Under Nadella, Microsoft finally accepted that it doesn\u2019t have a significant user base in smartphones. The company realized that if it didn't open up to rival platforms, it would miss out on a lot of users. And that\u2019s one of the first things Nadella did after taking the charge of the company. Microsoft launched Office on iOS. Until then Office was only available on Windows, Windows RT, and Windows Phone, and a half-baked mobile version on Android.\nThe move received an overwhelming response from users, resulting in Office apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- top the app chart in within 24 hours of their release on the platform. Late last year, the company made premium access to the Office suite free on iOS and Android. Office for iOS was in the works at Microsoft for a long time, but Ballmer used to prioritize its products on Windows devices first. Nadella evidently changed that.\n\"We have", "baseline_completion": "accomplished a lot together during our first 40 years and empowered countless businesses and people to realize their full potential. But what matters most now is what we do next\", Gates writes in his email. Microsoft does have a lot of things to look forward to in the coming months and years. Later this year, Microsoft will release Windows 10 for desktop computers, as well as smartphones, IoT devices and Xbox One. In the coming months, Microsoft will also release the next iteration of its productivity suite, Office 2016. For the first time, the company is simultaneously releasing Office on OS X and Windows.\nAdditionally, Microsoft has showcased a number of products that could change the way we compute and interact with technology. Its augmented reality headset HoloLens is just one example. It will be interesting to see what the company does next and how things work out for it in the coming years.", "orig_sample_length": 1085, "prompt_length": 885, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the resources to drive and solve tough problems.

The truth is, the world's top developers use Microsoft tools because they're the best tools. They're the best because the most people use them, and the most people use them because they're the best tools\", Nadella wrote in his email to employees, adding that the open ecosystem was a \"critical milestone\" in the company's transformation.\n\"We're also delivering new experiences like Cortana, which helps you get more productive.

{"idx": 78, "truncated_input": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy \u2014 a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren\u2019t entirely bad, of course, and they\u2019re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we\u2019ll want to go next or what songs we\u2019ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they\u2019re interested in. As with similarly devised services \u2014 LinkedIn\u2019s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph \u2014 the new feature\u2019s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we\u2019re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data \u2014 personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it \u2014 these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they\u2019re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data\u2019s George Washington?\nThis is why I\u2019m so excited about Tableau\u2019s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau\u2019s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I\u2019ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound \u2014 it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) \u2014 but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it\u2019s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today\u2019s free users will be tomorrow\u2019s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company\u2019s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That\u2019s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick \u2013 appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe\u2019re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible \u2013 and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that\u2019s missing from what I can see is the education \u2013 knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution \u2013 but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the \u2018how\u2019 to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I\u2019m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who\u2019s got that vision, I\u2019d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we\u2019re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a \u201csearch engine for data\u201d that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I\u2019ve worked at, I\u2019ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: \u201ca historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite\u201d. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these \u201cshadow IT\u201d projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (", "baseline_completion": "MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we\u2019ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks.\nThanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that\u2019s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic.", "orig_sample_length": 2139, "prompt_length": 1939, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Microsoft), etc. Many of these products are built on top of their existing BI products and are geared to business users.\nI think you are spot on with the vision for how this will evolve.\nI think the issue isn\u2019t so much about the data but just about the analysis. If you look at a lot of the successes in this space, they are not the people who are coming up with the new data sources but rather the people who are making sense of the data. So, you have an app like Datahero that allows you to mashup different data sources and then make an analysis.

{"idx": 81, "truncated_input": "Two Democratic state representatives from South Florida said Thursday that they've gathered with 33 colleagues to file paperwork with the Secretary of State to poll lawmakers for their support for a special session.\nAt the end of session, superintendents and the statewide teachers' union called for the Legislature to redo their education funding in the budget they were about to pass. When a special session seemed imminent on gambling issues, again, they made the same call, without success.\nNow, Democrats have organized a last-ditch effort to use an obscure state law to poll lawmakers on their willingness to come back for a special session to address education funding.\nState Reps. Shevrin Jones of West Park and Nicholas Duran of Miami said Thursday that they and 33 others have filed petitions with the Florida Secretary of State for the poll. This method of calling a special session circumvents the Republican Legislative leadership, who typically are the ones who must call any special sessions and declare its purpose.\nBoth Jones and Duran hail from the two counties, Broward and Miami-Dade, hit hardest by a change in the way the state calculates school funding this year, designed to direct more dollars to smaller districts. They, like the rest of the House members who aren't termed out, are up for re-election.\n\"In the aftermath of Parkland and the waning days of session, the Legislature took action for the safety of our schools,\" Duran said. \"In our rush to do something we didn't account for the conesequences of that bill 7026 and now the school districts are facing those consequences.\"\nSince the passage of this year's budget as well as SB 7026, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, school districts have been scrambling to comply with the new safety requirements as well as their normal operations. Several are considering raising local property taxes.\nDemocrats tried the same tactic after the Pulse shooting in the summer of 2016, in an effort to force a special session vote on guns. They failed to garner enough support to call the session.\nThis year's final vote on the budget was taken on March 11, the Sunday after the legislative session was supposed to end but it went into overtime after the Feb. 14 Parkland shooting changed the entire direction of the session and caused lawmakers to reconcile with issues like school safety and gun rights not previously taking center stage.\nJones was not present for the vote on the budget. He said it was because after the Legislature's official end date he needed to go back to his full-time job as the executive director of the Florida Reading Corps, a branch of", "baseline_completion": "AmeriCorps. Duran voted yes, along with many other Democrats who argued against the budget but who ultimately voted for it.\n\"When our members were presented with the budget, they were presented with something they did not like,\" Jones said. \"But (some are) going to vote for it because there are some good things in there.\"\nDespite the fact that Republicans have said repeatedly that they are proud of the investment they made this year in education, Jones said this poll at the very least will require every lawmaker to go on the record in an election year with their position on the current school funding levels.\nIt's unlikely the Democrats will succeed, but now that the Secretary of State has received Jones and Duran's petition, that office will send out the poll today. Lawmakers will have until noon on May 24 to respond, according to Sarah Revell from the Secretary of State's office.", "orig_sample_length": 816, "prompt_length": 616, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "AmeriCorps.\n\"The way that it's structured we have to get 25 percent of the members of the House to sign the petition, which is 71,\" Jones said. \"We've gotten a few signatures.\"\nJones said their petition will be filed with the Secretary of State's office Friday at 5 p.m.\nIt's not clear whether the petition would lead to any action.\n\"I don't know how many we'll get,\" he said. \"But I do know that even if I get 71 signatures, I'm not going to be the person who's responsible for bringing the Legislature back.

There are several horse farms in the area, but none came forward as the owner, Sickinger said.\nMoments after Sickinger started petting the horse, a truck drove by and the horse followed after it.

She said she was out in the same area Wednesday for about four hours, but didn\u2019t have any luck.\nShe warned area residents to avoid approaching the horse if they aren\u2019t familiar with how horses behave, and to slow down when driving through the area. Yoch said a horse standing in a road on a dark night can cause serious damage to a vehicle and hurt the driver, as well as the horse, of course.\nIt\u2019s possible the horse was dumped, according to Stephanie Goepfert, a member of the Lincoln Trail Riders in O\u2019Fallon.

She sat down recently to talk about language barriers, cabin fever and readjusting to life in east Sacramento.\nQ: Between orphanage work in Zimbabwe and Guatemala and clinic work in Bolivia, you\u2019re no stranger to long flights. How did that come about?\nA: I\u2019ve always enjoyed traveling, and then once I became a nurse, to be able to use that career overseas was really neat to me. What intrigued me about Mercy Ships is it\u2019s a fully run hospital \u2013 you have a lot of equipment, you have a lot of medications. It\u2019s a lot of what I get to do here, over there.\nI am a Christian, and I think a lot of it has to do with seeing how God\u2019s heart breaks when people are broken and poor. So much that you see is diseases of poverty.\nQ: In August, you were scheduled to join a Mercy Ships crew in Benin in West Africa, but the service was canceled due to a possible Ebola case. Months later, your own hospital became a designated Ebola treatment center, and you took part in the preparedness efforts. Would you have considered going overseas to provide care during the outbreak if given the chance?\nA: Had I been signed up with an Ebola team, I wouldn\u2019t have been opposed. I enjoy the risk. I think that\u2019s part of why I became a nurse, because there\u2019s always those risks out there. When that came up, I decided to not be scared and to take more education and learn more about Ebola. For me, it was just a decision of, I\u2019m a nurse, and I have risks even at UC Davis in Sacramento, and that\u2019s why we learn to protect ourselves.\nQ: You said you had a much heavier patient load and more limited resources on the ship than you do in Sacramento. What did you learn on this trip that you\u2019ll bring back to UCD?\nA: In the ward, there were 15 patients at a time with five nurses and five translators. There were people on the guitar and singing, and kids running around. It was a very different environment for me. I had to calculate my antibiotics and draw them up and mix them. It was just a stretch for me as a nurse, to need to focus on something, but also learn an art of nursing where I am appreciating and valuing the relationships of the Malagasy people. ... Just challenging my mind to see that I can function differently, and to bring that back to the burn unit is huge.\nQ: Working in the oral and facial ward, you said you saw a lot of patients with physical obstructions that had long been neglected, such as large dental tumors or cleft palates.

When they have that healing, they finally feel like they can enter society again.\nQ: Even on top of the jet lag, you must have a lot going on right now. How do you readjust to your old life?\nA: I\u2019ve done the reverse culture shock thing before, of coming to the U.S. and feeling like this is crazy. For me, it\u2019s always reminding myself that these are two beautiful cultures that are different. There are good things about both of them. For me, knowing that God is present in both and working in both helps. But I never want to forget what I see.", "orig_sample_length": 916, "prompt_length": 716, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "bigger than your face. They don\u2019t have a mirror to look at themselves, so they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re so happy and so grateful. It\u2019s a really neat thing to tell a child who\u2019s 12 years old that you can remove that tumor. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done before.\nQ: What are some of your most vivid memories from the trip?\nA: In the oral and facial ward, we had a woman who was 12 months pregnant. She had a big mass on her neck, and it was so big it was growing down her throat. She was so miserable, but she was so grateful. I think she was going to die. She had a tumor. I watched her recover, and she was able to see her daughter for the first time. I think that was really an awesome experience", "w_wm_output": "been there since you\u2019ve been a kid. ...

These people have become hopeful, and they have been able to be with their family like they have never been able to be with their family.\nQ: What was the most difficult part of the trip?\nA: It\u2019s hard being away from your own family \u2013 I was the only bachelorette without kids. One thing we did was my aunt-in-law would send me a picture of my niece, and so I had a picture of her. My nephew\u2019s face was stuck to the screen, and I would just look at his little smile and it would bring me a lot of joy.\nQ: How many times", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.9342978000640869, 0.6749870181083679, 0.6576265096664429, 0.621506929397583, 0.45100468397140503, 0.47067129611968994, 0.49694889783859253, 0.7818411588668823, 0.7030203342437744, 0.6009703278541565, 0.9241724014282227, 0.9221996665000916, 0.8232155442237854, 0.8923464417457581, 0.7128573656082153, 0.3522785007953644, 0.8693499565124512, 0.9050681591033936, 0.8227738738059998, 0.8337137699127197, 0.7996301651000977, 0.4891611635684967, 0.7777239680290222, 0.7571712136268616, 0.7430398464202881, 0.8003593683242798, 0.7826597690582275, 0.7592637538909912, 0.890526294708252, 0.868276834487915, 0.9042275547981262, 0.871014416217804, 0.8136898875236511, 0.9725975394248962, 0.36737170815467834, 0.5846834182739258, 0.9262306690216064, 0.8457151651382446, 0.7378955483436584, 0.8066735863685608, 0.4528593420982361, 0.8400163054466248, 0.7280383110046387, 0.5566180944442749, 0.9171802997589111, 0.8238546848297119, 0.8019823431968689, 0.6945072412490845, 0.865227460861206, 0.9209181070327759, 0.7576943635940552, 0.8438108563423157, 0.7539864778518677, 0.774560809135437, 0.4120192527770996, 0.7367432713508606, 0.6331449151039124, 0.8268107771873474, 0.5872307419776917, 0.35289013385772705, 0.8180412650108337, 0.521964967250824, 0.8953958749771118, 0.8060524463653564, 0.9092215895652771, 0.586688220500946, 0.8285772800445557, 0.8629834055900574, 0.934119701385498, 0.4698423147201538, 0.8236017227172852, 0.6887874007225037, 0.7464361786842346, 0.6892715096473694, 0.9301812648773193, 0.9074812531471252, 0.35465648770332336, 0.9584557414054871, 0.9680453538894653, 0.5837216377258301, 0.5856848955154419, 0.7619675993919373, 0.7957279682159424, 0.7191388607025146, 0.5671883821487427, 0.502151608467102, 0.5887460708618164, 0.3604758381843567, 0.6517437100410461, 0.6646146774291992, 0.3888782858848572, 0.39831799268722534, 0.601767361164093, 0.7992684841156006, 0.4797074794769287, 0.35237178206443787, 0.8804791569709778, 0.8641060590744019, 0.6828502416610718, 0.7424649000167847, 0.8080959916114807, 0.6264655590057373, 0.5006420612335205, 0.7337393760681152, 0.7031511664390564, 0.5515561103820801, 0.4054892063140869, 0.3578937351703644, 0.3521438241004944, 0.8587595224380493, 0.6101263165473938, 0.35491886734962463, 0.8918797969818115, 0.6790554523468018, 0.7452019453048706, 0.40062010288238525, 0.7473447322845459, 0.6115577220916748, 0.7487237453460693, 0.679970920085907, 0.9206349849700928, 0.8603597283363342, 0.8482480049133301, 0.643345296382904, 0.8051590323448181, 0.394083708524704, 0.3522479236125946, 0.6228927373886108, 0.7257371544837952, 0.748214840888977, 0.35323017835617065, 0.7074018120765686, 0.860120415687561, 0.6376227140426636, 0.6393235325813293, 0.9239640235900879, 0.8577483892440796, 0.9195282459259033, 0.9372957944869995, 0.45535722374916077, 0.8348485231399536, 0.5820471048355103, 0.35283493995666504, 0.35973620414733887, 0.9190816879272461, 0.8914440274238586, 0.6385869383811951, 0.8727579116821289, 0.8948384523391724, 0.5920340418815613, 0.6058590412139893, 0.7211430072784424, 0.49139297008514404, 0.7446717023849487, 0.5940704345703125, 0.7205621004104614, 0.6773290038108826, 0.7914039492607117, 0.8162358999252319, 0.811816930770874, 0.627708375453949, 0.5947955846786499, 0.8519136905670166, 0.8770931363105774, 0.9150592088699341, 0.40828967094421387, 0.9004734754562378, 0.3521764576435089, 0.918255627155304, 0.7872011065483093, 0.8801827430725098, 0.6112061738967896, 0.6590312719345093, 0.9160175919532776, 0.7997093796730042, 0.6093152761459351, 0.753503143787384, 0.853359580039978, 0.9212367534637451, 0.8882429003715515, 0.4047624468803406, 0.7387392520904541, 0.6398183703422546, 0.6484960317611694, 0.663623034954071, 0.9194886684417725, 0.7132511138916016, 0.8008894920349121, 0.591996967792511, 0.8568528890609741, 0.5392623543739319, 0.3565633296966553, 0.662432074546814, 0.4915332794189453, 0.7622643709182739, 0.6236425042152405, 0.3533487915992737, 0.8551265001296997, 0.8253298997879028, 0.9119529724121094]}

{"idx": 88, "truncated_input": "Ford is building cars that \"talk\" with traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians.\nAt CES 2019 in Las Vegas on Monday, the automaker announced plans to start selling cars that feature this type of technology in 2022.\nThe technology, called cellular vehicle-to-everything (or C-V2X for short), uses wireless signals to share road data, such as a car's location or the color of a traffic light, with other vehicles.\nFord believes it will make cities safer by better informing drivers of their surroundings, and compares the innovation to the invention of the traffic light in the 19th century.\n\"The world's first traffic light [helped] people move through a congested London intersection that had become dangerous for pedestrians due to the popularity of horse-drawn carriages,\" Don Butler, executive director of Ford Connected Vehicle Platform and Product, wrote in a Medium post. \"At Ford, 150 years later, we are excited to continue advancing this type of thinking.\"\nBut critics says the cost of installing the technology will be burdensome for cash-strapped governments. Corinne Kisner, deputy director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, called the expense of installing and maintaining vehicle-to-everything technology a major concern. Many municipalities struggle to fill their potholes, let alone install smart city technology. She also described any effort to require a pedestrian to carry a smartphone to guarantee safety as a dangerous paradigm shift.\n\"It's an unreasonable burden to ask or require people walking in their streets and cities and in front of their homes to carry a signal transmitting device,\" Kisner said. \"The burden needs to be on the driver of the two-ton vehicle, whether it's a human or autonomous technology.\"\nFord sees things differently. Butler described to CNN Business the example of a pedestrian walking on a dirt road who might be identified by a car with C-V2X because they were carrying a smartphone. Traditionally, a driver would rely on their headlights to see the pedestrian. But Butler stops short of expecting smartphones to be recommended or required for pedestrians.\n\"It's like the question of will people be permitted to drive once autonomous vehicles become prevalent,\" Butler said. \"That's something we can only speculate about.\"\nFord isn't the first company to explore outfitting pedestrians with sensors. Siemens, the German conglomerate, began a US Department of Transportation pilot test in Tampa, Florida, last year using pedestrians' smartphones to communicate their location to vehicles. But Siemens officials found the smartphone location data to be so inaccurate that it wasn't useful.\nThe pilot was reworked to focus on outfitting 1,000 vehicles with sensors, and notifying drivers of nearby vehicles with audio alerts, according to Dave Miller, the head of connected vehicles at Siemens.", "baseline_completion": "\nBicycling advocates also argued it was unrealistic to require someone to carry a phone on roads.\n\"We think the way things are headed, what we need is more smart sensors [built] in the roadway, or infrastructure,\" Miller told CNN Business.\nThis is something Ford wants, too. It sees the coming arrival of 5G networks -- the next-generation of internet speed -- as a chance to install vehicle-to-everything technology throughout cities.\n\"We think there's an opportunity for a win-win that helps offset to a significant degree the cost a city might have to otherwise undertake to deploy this infrastructure,\" Butler said.\nFord is urging other automakers to install C-V2X in their vehicles.\nBut there's a long road ahead for Ford to make C-V2X as widespread as the traffic light, which took decades to be popularized.", "orig_sample_length": 891, "prompt_length": 691, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "\n\"If I am a pedestrian, I would like my smartphone to know where I am and to communicate that to the vehicles,\" Miller said. \"But I don't want to carry around a box on my shoulder. I want to be able to walk.\"\nFord's C-V2X technology could be more accurate than a pedestrian's smartphone, according to Butler. Ford is working with a company called Quuppa to develop the technology. Quuppa, a Finnish company, already makes similar C-V2X technology used by tram operators in Helsinki, Finland, and by a company in Germany to monitor and manage freight containers.\nPedestrian safety is one of the cornerstones of C-V2X. The technology could be used to warn drivers of \"blind\" spots in their mirrors, or to slow down drivers who are speeding or tailgating.\n\"If", "w_wm_output": "He noted that the pilot was designed to explore the technology, and the company has not put a timeline for when the pilot will be completed.\nSiemens is one of many companies working on the technology. NTT Group, the Japanese telecoms giant, is another firm that's exploring the technology and plans to roll it out this spring. NTT is partnering on the technology with automakers including Honda, Nissan, and Mitsubishi.\nButler said the technology could make roads safer in places where pedestrians regularly walk outside of crosswalks, like the area outside a school. He also pointed to a New York Times story from last year about a pedestrian struck by a truck at a crosswalk near Madison Square Garden, which he said wasn't protected by a traffic light.\nSmartphones have become omnipresent, and the technology could be a way for pedestrians to use", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.7444891929626465, 0.8279672861099243, 0.5442444086074829, 0.8725860118865967, 0.9527631402015686, 0.8831893801689148, 0.9658649563789368, 0.5062826871871948, 0.9317559003829956, 0.8292262554168701, 0.9335917234420776, 0.7276226282119751, 0.6614030003547668, 0.8147815465927124, 0.8978188037872314, 0.880580723285675, 0.7505438327789307, 0.8118430376052856, 0.5226204991340637, 0.7506501078605652, 0.4477918744087219, 0.4451131224632263, 0.8981484174728394, 0.6829580068588257, 0.8640598058700562, 0.6345828771591187, 0.751230001449585, 0.7311581969261169, 0.425666868686676, 0.47834962606430054, 0.8703675866127014, 0.48829713463783264, 0.3544837534427643, 0.8848064541816711, 0.8824949264526367, 0.37326279282569885, 0.7873731255531311, 0.6033878326416016, 0.8980069756507874, 0.6291923522949219, 0.8824445009231567, 0.7087730169296265, 0.619511067867279, 0.9157782793045044, 0.4822186827659607, 0.6647268533706665, 0.5286230444908142, 0.6942059993743896, 0.4820306599140167, 0.6434459090232849, 0.5047341585159302, 0.7789844274520874, 0.730589747428894, 0.39204874634742737, 0.8312788009643555, 0.877185583114624, 0.7605028748512268, 0.8586851358413696, 0.7554169297218323, 0.35182130336761475, 0.9227678775787354, 0.3853200078010559, 0.8409340977668762, 0.7645872235298157, 0.6238359808921814, 0.9132567644119263, 0.38136082887649536, 0.8905975818634033, 0.5346055626869202, 0.3541055917739868, 0.7011188864707947, 0.44239404797554016, 0.669026792049408, 0.8320009112358093, 0.36662355065345764, 0.9026445150375366, 0.9113063216209412, 0.385615736246109, 0.3650745749473572, 0.6058474779129028, 0.7237579822540283, 0.4038272798061371, 0.9252079129219055, 0.5650675296783447, 0.8451080322265625, 0.8456503748893738, 0.35429856181144714, 0.5469112396240234, 0.8351532220840454, 0.3554791212081909, 0.35168832540512085, 0.5337981581687927, 0.8337954878807068, 0.8113104701042175, 0.3566247522830963, 0.35215654969215393, 0.3525877892971039, 0.604513943195343, 0.6510105133056641, 0.9312019348144531, 0.8682018518447876, 0.8319078087806702, 0.7482054233551025, 0.879304826259613, 0.8256765604019165, 0.8408190011978149, 0.8981990218162537, 0.47057902812957764, 0.3515165150165558, 0.8145570755004883, 0.8853166699409485, 0.678948163986206, 0.9418352246284485, 0.35166001319885254, 0.4626389145851135, 0.3515034019947052, 0.8077933192253113, 0.8025041818618774, 0.8616006374359131, 0.5692002773284912, 0.6959981918334961, 0.3677991032600403, 0.3515097200870514, 0.6614025235176086, 0.7861181497573853, 0.9062458276748657, 0.9788374304771423, 0.7799621820449829, 0.754327118396759, 0.8933461904525757, 0.6699739098548889, 0.8163770437240601, 0.8192945122718811, 0.8537620306015015, 0.4538375735282898, 0.8853853344917297, 0.9480804800987244, 0.5125382542610168, 0.6736327409744263, 0.7388953566551208, 0.7671838402748108, 0.7654078006744385, 0.6226392984390259, 0.7174292802810669, 0.663805365562439, 0.9323800206184387, 0.3526613712310791, 0.3521993160247803, 0.7846929430961609, 0.5867833495140076, 0.4401388466358185, 0.7609262466430664, 0.3733954429626465, 0.7955623865127563, 0.7033153176307678, 0.7548216581344604, 0.36169448494911194, 0.7965787649154663, 0.8515998125076294, 0.3525027632713318, 0.4030727446079254, 0.5347002148628235, 0.6810389757156372, 0.8740715980529785, 0.9358733892440796, 0.6515305042266846, 0.9041211605072021, 0.352804958820343, 0.3515091836452484, 0.9428495168685913, 0.45455002784729004, 0.6856517791748047, 0.738099992275238, 0.4912060499191284, 0.5339152216911316, 0.6272100210189819, 0.6921409964561462, 0.3837704360485077, 0.8246362209320068, 0.35156553983688354, 0.8947437405586243, 0.8514378070831299, 0.8717316389083862, 0.35654711723327637, 0.3554438054561615, 0.7205405235290527, 0.7499386072158813, 0.9424383640289307, 0.89565509557724, 0.9052371978759766, 0.9043460488319397, 0.9139581918716431, 0.9109562039375305, 0.5275882482528687, 0.8902850151062012, 0.35156628489494324, 0.3550562858581543, 0.3515060245990753, 0.4660176932811737, 0.9581642150878906]}

{"idx": 93, "truncated_input": "Customers line up to purchase lottery tickets, Monday, Oct. 22, 2018, at La Preferida Superdiscount store in Hialeah, Fla.\nFor all the anticipation about whether someone will finally snag the gigantic Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots, the games come down to two things: simple math \u2014 and very long odds.\nBut there are some quirks and surprises about the math equations that likely will soon vault someone into stratospheric wealth after the jackpots grew for months without a winner.\nThe biggest quirk starts with this fact: The advertised $1.6 billion Mega Millions prize \u2014 the world's largest ever lottery jackpot \u2014 and $620 million Powerball prize aren't quite real. That is, those are the amount you'd be paid if you chose an annuity, doled out over 29 years. Nearly every winner opts for cash, which is the amount of money the lottery folks actually have in the bank ready to pay out to the company that would fund the annuity.\nThe cash option is still massive, at $904 million for Mega Millions and $354.3 million for Powerball. But those numbers aren't splayed across billboards and shown in countless mini marts across America.\nThe dismal odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot \u2014 1 in 302.5 million \u2014 mean there are 302.5 million potential number combinations, or a little less than one combination for each of the 328 million people living in the U.S. For last Friday's drawing, about 59 per cent of possible combinations were taken. But by Tuesday night's drawing, officials estimate that 75 per cent will be sold.\nThat would mean a 25 per cent chance of no winner. If that happens, it's likely even more combinations would be covered before the next drawing three days later. Officials don't have an estimate on how many tickets would be sold for that potential drawing, and they haven't said how large the estimated prize would be. Could it reach $2 billion?\nThe odds of winning Powerball are 1 in 292.2 million.\nThe odds of winning don't change as jackpots get larger, but the chance that more than one winner will share the prize do. When so many people rush to play as a jackpot soars , the chances increase that two or three tickets \u2014 of the millions of tickets sold \u2014 will match. Of the five largest jackpots awarded in the U.S., three went to multiple winners. The largest single prize went to a 2017 player from Massachusetts who celebrated a $758.7 million Powerball payday.\nIf the odds of winning either Mega Millions or Powerball don't seem gigantic enough, how about winning them both? Spend $4 on a ticket for each game and it could happen. But the odds aren't especially favourable, at about 1 in 88 quadrillion (that's 88,000,000,000,000,000).\nFor Mega Millions, players choose six numbers: five from a range of white balls, numbered 1 to 70, and one number for the Mega Ball, with a range of 1 to 25. What numbers have come up most? Since 2010, that honour goes to the number 2, with 92 hits, followed by the numbers 20, 11, 31 and 17. The most hit Mega Ball number is 9.\nLottery officials are quick to point out that the number selection is random, so there's no reason that what hit in the past will be selected again. The game also has changed over the years, so some numbers included weren't always in the mix.\nNot surprisingly, the most Mega Million jackpot winners in the past five years have come from states with the largest populations. New York, with the nation's fourth-largest population, leads with seven winners. The No. 1 population state of California is second in Mega Millions winners with six, while Illinois is third with four winners.\nStill, there are some quirks, as Georgia has the eight-largest population and three", "baseline_completion": "winners and Washington state has two winners but only the 13th largest population. Texas has the nation's second-largest population, yet players have only bought winning Mega Millions tickets in the state twice in the past five years. And let's hear it for Rhode Island, the smallest population state to have won a Mega Millions jackpot in the past five years.\nFor those with an international bent, the current Mega Millions jackpot has surpassed all lottery jackpot records \u2014 so it's not only the largest lottery prize in U.S. history, it's now the world's largest.\nThe annual El Gordo national lottery in Spain advertises a larger total prize pool, but the money is divvied up into many prizes, according to Seth Elkin, a spokesman for the Maryland lottery, which currently takes questions about the Mega Millions drawing.", "orig_sample_length": 1184, "prompt_length": 984, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Mega Millions winners.\nThe Powerball game has a lot of numbers, too. Players choose six numbers from two separate sets of numbers: five from a range of 1 to 69, and one from a range of 1 to 26. The last Powerball winner hit the jackpot by guessing all six numbers correctly. The most often selected Powerball numbers are 16, 22, 42, 57 and 34. The most often selected Powerball number is 22.\nThere have been only two Powerball jackpot winners in the past five years from the states with the largest populations. California, with the second-largest population, leads with four jackpot winners, followed by Florida with three. The largest population state of New York has only two winners.\nThere's been only one Powerball jackpot winner in the smallest state, Rhode Island.\nIt might seem", "w_wm_output": "Mega Millions winners since 2013. New Jersey, which has the 11th-largest population, is No. 5 in Mega Millions winners with three.\nThe Powerball game, played in 44 states as well as Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, is simpler. Players simply pick five numbers from 1 to 69, and a Powerball number from 1 to 26.\nSince the beginning of 2014, the number 14 has appeared most often, with 54 times, followed closely by 22 with 53. As with the Mega Millions, the number 17 also has appeared 53 times.

{"idx": 96, "truncated_input": "MidMichigan Health plans to restructure and re-align its work force in the coming months, and the changes could mean laying off as many as 1 percent of the company's nearly 5,000 workers.\nMidMichigan Health is the parent company of MidMichigan Medical Center-Midland as well as Medical Centers in Clare, Gladwin and Alma. The company also owns other health care facilities including home health care and nursing homes.\nIn a news release, the company said the restructuring is needed because of changes in the way health care is provided, the economy and health reform. These factors are affecting health care organizations in Michigan and nationwide, the news release stated.\nThe health system has a work force of 4,831. Officials will not know the number of employees who could lose their jobs until the restructuring is completed in mid-May. But it is expected to be less than 1 percent of all employees.\nCompany officials said these changes are happening just as demand for health care services is increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. Growing areas include physician practices, emergency services and critical care. In the past nine months, MidMichigan has added 50 new physicians and what the company calls mid-level providers. New positions include primary-care providers, specialists and a new critical care team.\n\"MidMichigan's vision is to be an integrated health system, and we have been working toward that vision for more than three years,\" said Richard M. Reynolds, president of MidMichigan Health. \"With changes in the health care environment and declining reimbursement we are challenged to shift our resources and realign our employees to continue to provide excellent clinical quality and excellent patient experiences in a safe environment. Doing that means that we have to change", "baseline_completion": "and re-tool how we do things.\"\nDeveloping new physician practices requires clinical and support staff. As a result, MidMichigan Health plans to take staff members from under-utilized areas and put them in open positions. Some people could lose their jobs, the company said, because they cannot be redeployed into open positions.\nManagement of some departments throughout the four hospitals will be re-aligned, and some services will be consolidated, the news release said.\n\"Our business is changing,\" said Lynn Bruchhof, MidMichigan Health vice president of human resources. \"We are fortunate to be able to realign our talent resources, our people, to areas of growth and need throughout MidMichigan Health.\"\nSome employees will retire, while others are volunteering to take part-time positions, and still others are applying for the 120 open positions in MidMichigan Health, she said.", "orig_sample_length": 600, "prompt_length": 400, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the way we work and align our work force with our growing clinical services.\"\nOfficials said MidMichigan's biggest challenge is providing quality, efficient and safe care in the face of declining reimbursement.\n\"In fact, Medicare reimbursement is declining faster than the rate of inflation,\" said Reynolds.\nInpatient reimbursement is declining by 6 percent in 2011, he said. In addition, the Medicaid program has been underfunded, which has caused a significant shortage of physicians willing to participate in Medicaid.\n\"In our region, the physician shortage is the most significant problem facing our health system and our community,\" Reynolds said. \"We are responding to the shortage by strengthening our primary care and specialty care services, which will help us attract more physicians to the region to meet the health care needs of our patients", "w_wm_output": "how we operate, and it means that we have to change our people to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving industry.\"\nThe company is also expanding its primary-care services, including a primary-care clinic in Gladwin as well as a primary-care clinic at the former Central Michigan University Health Network.\nThe restructuring could change the roles of some employees.

{"idx": 98, "truncated_input": "Tennessee farmers are cashing in on the local food movement.\nThe federal government never measured just how much Tennessee farmers sold directly to customers at, say, a farmers market, but when it did (for the first time this year), it found a huge, farm-fresh, steaming pile of cash.\nTennessee consumers spent more than $58.7 million with farmers directly in 2015, according to the first survey on direct-to-consumer sales from the federal government. Across the country, Tennessee ranks 15th for the number of farms selling directly to consumers.\n\"We know that many people care about what they eat and want to know where their food comes from,\" said Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton. \"This survey shows what that farmer-to-consumer relationship is worth in Tennessee.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted the survey to get data on the growing and changing local-food sectors across the country. It found that 4,148 Tennessee farms sold food directly to consumers in 2015, and more are getting in the game in a hurry.\n\"The number of farms selling directly to consumers increased more than 500 in the three years since the [last agriculture census],\" said Debra Kenerson, a Tennessee state statistician. \"This shows tremendous growth in a short period of time.\"\nThe farm sales include fresh foods like meat and vegetables but also edible processed foods like bottled milk, cheese, meat, jam, cider, and wine. Farmers sold these goods to institutions like schools, universities, hospitals, wholesalers, and distributors.\nBut farmers also sold their goods directly to the person who would eat them at farmers markets, farm stores, roadside stands, through community supported agriculture (CSA) arrangements, online sales, pick-your-own operations, and mobile markets.\nSandy Watson, a board member with the Cooper-Young Community Farmers Market, said the more consumers are educated on the importance of eating locally sourced, healthy food, the more likely they are to hit farmers markets for their weekly grocery shopping.\nThis, Watson said, is fueling the local food movement. That movement is responsible for the year-over-year growth seen at the Cooper-Young market and responsible for the big numbers the government found when looking at direct-to-consumer farm sales.\nThose big sales figures, too, provide a \"real opportunity for more farmers to capitalize on the 'buy local' movement,\" Kenerson said.\nThe strength of that \"buy local movement\" is a big reason the Cooper-", "baseline_completion": "Young market is now open year-round.\n\"We don't stop eating when winter comes, and many of the local farmers are producing year-round,\" Watson said. \"Our winter market is just as busy as the spring/summer market, and some of the best vegetables are those grown in the winter.\"\nWhile much of the food consumed in Memphis was not likely grown here, a move is underway to change that. Last year, the East Arkansas Planning and Development District and the Memphis-Shelby County Office of Sustainability launched Delta Roots: The Mid-South Regional Food System Plan.\nThe plan lays out a 20-year path to a local, sustainable food network here in which consumers will eat more locally grown products and farmers can cash in on the $550 million annual demand for produce in the Memphis area.", "orig_sample_length": 806, "prompt_length": 606, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Young market, which is the top performer in the country, is adding a second location. The new market, which will open this weekend, is in Overton Park.\nWhile the income from direct-to-consumer sales is great, Watson wants local farmers to do better.\n\"Our farmers are not making nearly enough money,\" she said.\nWatson said that farmers, on average, need to make at least $15,000 a year to make it in the business. She thinks farmers can do better than that.\n\"We've got them doing everything right,\" she said. \"And we know we can do even better.\"\nWatson said farmers are doing well by selling to consumers but need to do better by selling to restaurants and institutions.

{"idx": 100, "truncated_input": "Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesReynaldo Rodriguez of the Care Coordination program counseled a patient with H.I.V. on how to adhere to a drug regimen.\nDoctors are very good at telling us what to do \u2014 but we are very poor at doing it. In fact, the health problems of millions of Americans are directly related to our failure to follow doctors\u2019 orders.\nDoctors tell us to take our pills, exercise, go get that C.T. scan, stop smoking, change our diets, cut out salt, quit drinking, monitor our blood sugar. We know we should do it, but we very often don\u2019t. About three-quarters of patients do not keep appointments for follow-up care. In one study of diabetes patients, only 7 percent were compliant enough with their treatment plans to control the disease. Even people at grave and immediate risk do not always take their medicines: a quarter of kidney transplant patients in one study did not take their medicines correctly, putting them at risk for organ rejection. Among elderly patients with congestive heart failure, 15 percent of repeat hospitalizations were linked to failure to take prescribed medicines. And compliance with exercise and diet programs is even worse. Poor compliance is a major reason that sick people don\u2019t get better, and that our health care costs are so high.\nIt is a reason that often gets ignored. Many doctors are uncomfortable wrestling with adherence. They may even believe that it is not their problem, that their job is done when they write the prescription or hand the patient a diet plan. But even concerned doctors would find themselves helpless in a 10-minute office visit. They are too removed from their patients, too much the authority figure to really get to the bottom of why a patient isn\u2019t doing what he is supposed to.\nBad adherence doesn\u2019t discriminate by social class. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with high cholesterol and blood pressure and yet can\u2019t manage to stick to an exercise program. Far fewer \u2014 but far sicker and more expensive to the health care system \u2014 are the handful of emergency room frequent flyers: people with multiple serious conditions such as AIDS, diabetes, hypertension, depression, mental illness, social isolation, substance abuse or domestic violence. Such people have extraordinary problems sticking to their plans to get better, and need extraordinary help.\nJoe McManus is a 56-year-old former heroin and crack addict who lives in a single-resident-occupancy apartment in Manhattan. He spent 15 years as an addict, about 10 of them homeless. In some ways, he\u2019s far from the typical homeless person. He used to work on Wall Street and still retains some of his Wall Street friends. In 2005, one of those friends took him to the Super Bowl.\nIn other ways, he is absolutely typical of drug users who have hit bottom. McManus has AIDS, Hepatitis C and liver problems. \u201cMy doctors went three or four years with me not showing up,\u201d he said in a recent interview in his apartment. \u201cI had no relationship with her \u2014 except for her to put me in the hospital because I didn\u2019t listen to what she had to say. I was still not addressing the fact that I was H.I.V.-positive. I was not taking my medicine and only going to the hospital when I had to be put in the hospital. I was still messing around with drugs.\u201d McManus was hospitalized four times in the year before November, 2009. Then he got a visit from Reynaldo Rodriguez.\nWhen Rodriguez first visited McManus, he had already quit drugs, on his own. But he was still living as if he were homeless. His apartment was covered with soot and grime, the bed had cigarette burns and the refrigerator held moldy food. McManus was treating his apartment like it was the street. \u201cHow the hell are you living like this?\u201d Rodriguez blurted out.\nIt made a difference. McManus started taking his medicines. The medicines brought down his viral load \u2014 he was getting better, and that motivated him to take care of himself. McManus is thin and twitchy, but when I saw him was dressed in jeans and a nice zippered sweater, and the apartment was in reasonable condition. McManus is now 100 percent adherent to his medicines, and his hospital stays amounted to only a single night in the last 16 months. He said that part of it was a spiritual awakening, but it was clear that Rodriguez played a huge role. McManus now goes to all his doctor\u2019s appointments on his own.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he follows all of his doctor\u2019s advice. He\u2019s no longer doing crack, but he\u2019s still drinking \u2014 several nights a week he goes to hang out in a friend\u2019s bar. He loves the bar \u2014 it\u2019s his entire social network.\nBut his Hepatitis C makes this dangerous behavior, and his doctor was stern: \u201cYou can not ever have a drink again. Not even on your birthday,\u201d she told him. \u201cI never have to tell you if I ever have one,\u201d McManus thought to himself.\nRodriguez and McManus worked out a compromise: he could keep going to the bar, but he had to tell his friends about his health problems so they would put the brakes on. He had to try to drink less, and keep doing tests that monitored his liver.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very honest with me,\u201d Rodriguez said. Why more than with your doctor? I asked McManus.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a doctor,\u201d he said.\nThe Care Coordination program, a city-wide initiative now in 28 sites in different hospitals around New York, was inspired and trained by a Boston-based program called PACT, for Prevention, Access to Care and Treatment. PACT is part of Partners in Health \u2014 a nongovernmental group famous for its work in Haiti, Rwanda and elsewhere. Part of Partners\u2019 strategy is to use people from the community who are paid a stipend to visit patients, watch them take their pills and support them. Since 1995, PACT has been using these ideas in tough neighborhoods of Boston, first with H.I.V. patients and now with people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. The PACT project trains people from the community, some of whom have the same diseases and similar problems as their patients, to be community health workers.\nThe new health reform law encourages pilot programs to try different forms of medical homes, and the better care and cost savings that come from improving adherence with peers or lay people like Rodriguez are attractive. The New Yorker magazine writer Atul Gawande recently profiled two clinics that use this model, in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J.\nThere are successful programs that use nurses for outreach. The Nurse-Family Partnership sends nurses to visit low-income first-time mothers, beginning in pregnancy and continuing until the child is two. The program now operates in 32 states and has proven to greatly improve the life of both child and mother. The Camden program that Gawande wrote about also uses nurses and nurse practitioners to make home visits.\nBut nurses are expensive home visitors, and they may not even be the best people for the job. \u201cGiven the rising cost of health care, we have found having peer-based health promoters providing care management is an equally effective way to provide high-quality care at a low cost,\u201d said Ayesha Cammaerts, the director of operations at PACT. \u201cEspecially with patients who suffer from substance abuse and mental health issues, they need someone they feel comfortable letting into their environment. Sometimes patients don\u2019t feel they can connect to clinicians from outside their community,\u201d she said.\nPACT", "baseline_completion": "\u2019s methods work. A study of AIDS patients found that the patients\u2019 use of appropriate medicines rose \u2014 they were becoming adherent. At the same time, spending on hospitalization dropped by nearly two-thirds. Overall, patient costs dropped by 36 percent. Even taking into account the $6,000-per-patient cost of PACT, patient costs dropped 16 percent. And in a group of people who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement.\nThe PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine. Many of the deficiencies of American health care require not more technology, but the human touch. It\u2019s certainly true for high-risk, high-cost patients, but it can help nearly everyone get better health for less money.

They have made a dent in emergency department use in the city of Boston.

{"idx": 101, "truncated_input": "And yet the Cardinals are in position to complete a three-game sweep of the Cubs on Sunday night after erasing deficits of 4-0 and 6-4 on Saturday before Kolten Wong's two-run walk-off homer in the 10th inning capped an 8-6 victory Saturday.\nThe win, however, cost the first-place Cardinals center fielder Tommy Pham, who left in the second inning with right groin tightness, catcher Yadier Molina, who left the game in the ninth inning after being hit by a foul tip, and closer Bud Norris in the 10th inning with a triceps injury.\nAccording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, manager Mike Matheny told reporters that all three players were candidates for replacements.\nDespite the injuries, though, the Cardinals improved to 3-1 this season against the two-time defending National League Central champions.\n\"I've never (played) in the World Series or those kinds of games,\" Cardinals outfielder Marcel Ozona told reporters after he tied the game in the ninth inning with a two-run double. \"This feels like more of a regular game.\"\nBut after trailing twice Saturday, including by two runs late, St. Louis' latest win felt like so much more than a normal game in early May.\n\"I'm telling you, we never feel like we're out of it,\" Cardinals third baseman Matt Carpenter told reporters, according to the team's official website. \"This was a really great win for us, and everybody had a piece of it.\"\nMichael Wacha (4-1, 3.62 ERA) will try to deliver the series sweep for the Cardinals, who have won four straight games.\nWacha won four straight games in April before he registered a no-decision last week against the Chicago White Sox when he allowed two runs and scattered five hits in five innings. Wacha is 4-7 with a 6.41 ERA in 16 games (14 starts) against the Cubs.\nThe Cubs will enter Sunday's primetime showdown having lost four straight games after putting together five straight victories. The Cubs finally showed promise offensively Saturday, when they snapped a nine-game string of games in which they scored three or fewer runs.\nBut after blowing two different leads as their slide continued, the Cubs will attempt to get back on track in Sunday's series finale.\nThe back and forth Cubs performance has been difficult to predict after they finished a 5-2 homestand despite struggling to score runs.\nManager Joe Maddon found silver linings in the Cubs' recent roller coaster ride and continues to point to how early in the season his team's Jekyll and Hyde act", "baseline_completion": "has surfaced.\n\"Regardless of what your plan may be, teams are going to go through these moments,\" Maddon told reporters before Saturday's game, according to the Chicago Tribune. \"It just happens to be ours right now. I want to continue to work like we've been working. I believe in our guys and believe in our methods. It's just the ebb and flow of the season. Right now, it's our turn. We'll come out of it and be fine.\"\nJon Lester will take the mound for the Cubs. Lester (2-1, 2.73) has already beaten the Cardinals once this season when he threw six innings and allowed an unearned run and two hits April 19.

If we lose the next two games, then we have a five-game losing streak. The season hasn't even started yet.\"\nKyle Hendricks (3-1, 3.40 ERA) will be on the mound in an attempt to right the Cubs' ship.\nHendricks allowed two runs and six hits in 7 1/3 innings during an 8-2 victory over the White Sox in his most recent start.

{"idx": 108, "truncated_input": "France is in a difficult position. It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to realize it. A capital strike against the periphery by both creditors in the Eurozone and international investors forced the periphery to adopt policies they would not have otherwise.\nLarge pools of capital, including central banks and sovereign wealth funds continue to buy French bonds, keeping yields near German levels. The logic is not so much about fair value based on economic fundamentals. Instead, it is a political judgment. Despite the divergence between German and French economic prowess, the two remain the twin pillars of Europe. As long as one is confident that EMU remains intact, then France's credit is as good as German credit.\nThat same logic, of course, can be applied to other euro area countries. On one hand, officials want investors to distinguish between different credit conditions. On the other hand, they insist they will not allow EMU to fail. As we have learned over the last couple of years, this does not preclude sovereign debt restructuring (Greece and Cyprus), and even capital controls (Cyprus).\nThe peripheral premium over Germany was narrower prior to the crisis. There was even a brief shining moment that Spain traded through Germany (this is to say that yields slipped marginally below German yields). Continued easing of ECB monetary policy can see spreads compress further. However, it is unreasonable to think the spreads can return to status quo ante, as the risk of debt restructuring must be perceived as higher than before.\nManagers of large pools of capital recognize there are not sufficient bunds available. Recall that next year, the German coalition government has committed itself to a balanced budget. That means new supply is not going to be forthcoming. French bonds are seen as the next best alternative, and they offer a slightly higher yield to boot. Simply, if crudely put, French bonds are to German bunds, what Agency debt is to US Treasuries.\nWithout the push of necessity, French politicians find it difficult to do the right thing. They are reluctant to declare a break from the German ordo-liberalism's drive for fiscal austerity, but refuse to embrace it. Last month, Hollande unilaterally declared no more effort to reach the EC budget targets that had already been postponed. The EC implicitly threatened to reject it, but reports suggesting that Merkel was reluctant to push France hard, possibly fearing to do to the AfD, what Cameron has done for the UKIP.\nInstead, the EC accepted some cockamamie sleight of hand. France would cut its structural deficit by 0.5% instead of 0.2% as Hollande initially proposed. This would be accomplished by 1) assuming lower debt servicing costs, 2) reducing its EU budget contribution, 3) proposing nearly a billion euro savings from a crackdown on tax evasion. Recall that Brussels had expected, and France had previously agreed to a 0.8% reduction in its structural deficit.\nPerhaps Merkel was worried about the rise of the National Front in France. Le Pen embraces the social welfare state of France. It sees the biggest threat to it, not coming from the discipline being imposed by what Thomas Friedman has called the \"golden straightjacket\", but by the encroachment of French sovereignty. The culprit is the German fist inside the EC glove and enshrined in the monetary union.\nYet the leaders of France's main political parties are doing more to boost the National Front than anyone, including, arguably, Marine Le Pen. She often claims that there is significant collusion between the major parties. She says that the Socialists and the UMP are a single self-interested group. The developments in France this week provide her with the proverbial smoking gun.\nConsider this: Hollande's chief of staff Jouyet is a personal friend of the French President. He also served in the Sarkozy government. He reportedly had lunch with Sarkozy's rival in the UMP, Fillon, who was also a prime minister in Sarkozy's government. Among the things they talked about was the investigation into overspending by the Sarkozy re-election campaign in 2012.\nWhat are not agreed upon are the reports that suggest Fillon, threatened by Sarkozy's attempt at a political comeback, wanted the Hollande government to expedite the investigation. The idea was hit Sarkozy quickly and hard to derail his hope to be elected as the head of the UMP next month. Yet, it does seem Sarkozy himself is struggling without any help. Ever since he threw his hat in the ring, his support in the polls has deteriorated. Last month, his candidate to head the Senate lost, suggesting Sarkozy's support in the UMP is not insurmountable.\nHollande's has the lowest support of any French president since the end of WWII. He is half-way through his five-year mandate, and he recently indicated he would not seek re-election if there were no improvement in the unemployment rate. It is an idle threat. Barring a miracle, he cannot win, and the Socialist Party may dump him. We might be witnessing the slow and painful death of the Fifth Republic. The other republics ended by war or a coup, but this one may be ending due to self-immolation. The Socialist candidate who ran against Sarkozy in 2007, S. Royal, who was once Hollande's life partner, used to talk about a Sixth Republic.\nAlthough Merkel is recognized as the outstanding leader in Europe, she is playing with a strong hand, the hand that holds the purse. France has a weak hand, and yet despite the lack of strong leadership, it has done remarkably well in pursuing its agenda. It has been given more time to reach the 3% deficit/GDP mandate. After years of complaining about the strong euro, in word and deed the ECB is now driving the euro lower.\nFrance has wanted the ECB to pursue aggressive monetary policy, which it now is. The ECB will likely increases the range of assets it is buying under its version of QE and if may include corporate bonds. Given that the French capital markets are more developments than most in the euro area, including Germany, its corporate bond market is among the largest. Almost 45% of the corporate bonds issued by Eurozone companies are accounted for by French businesses.\nAfter Russia occupied two areas in Georgia after the 2008 conflict, and its continuous in attempts to intimidate it neighbors, France thought it reasonable to sell Russia two ships that can be used for amphibious assaults. France has been reluctant to renege on its contract, which reportedly has penalty clauses for failure to deliver. However, within weeks of the expected delivery of the first ship, there is talk of an alternative. Reports suggest that NATO could be favorable disposed to buy the ships from France. Perhaps the logic is that it is better to own them then possibly fight against them.\nAsset managers are unlikely to declare a capital strike against France. The premium France pays over Germany for 10-year money is about 36 bp presently. In the past six months, the premium has approached 30 basis point a few times, but never penetrated. The mid-September low of 31 bp was the smallest French premium in three years. This", "baseline_completion": "seems to be the floor.\nThe ceiling seems to be about 47 bp, which it neared three times in the past six months, most recently on October 20. Recall that, in the four years before the crisis, there were several occasions where the French yield dipped slightly below the German yield. In any event, pre-crisis, France did not pay more than a 10 bp premium.\nNeither international capital, represented by asset managers nor the EC is going to force France to enact structural reforms. In addition, there is even less of a chance that Hollande makes a clean break and announces an aggressively pro-growth fiscal initiative. This means the continuation of the charade, yet the status quo is toxic. The political elite are committing a French version of hara-kiri. What fertile terrain for the National Front.", "orig_sample_length": 1972, "prompt_length": 1772, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "is one reason why France's 10-year bond yields have been remarkably steady.\nOn the other hand, the German premium over France has risen sharply, especially since the ECB's announcement late last month that it would expand its asset purchases under QE. The German 10-year yield is trading near 0.9% for the first time since early 2014. The 10-year French bond yield is trading near 1.45%, which is a new record low. The narrowing of the spreads, which in turn has been driving yields lower, is a function of increased demand for German bonds, which has been met by less demand for the peripheral bonds.\nIt is not only the German government that benefits from the narrowing of the peripheral premium. Banks and insurers benefit as well. The German government no longer needs to pay", "w_wm_output": "was the time that the ECB had just initiated a QE program and the euro had just penetrated parity versus the dollar.\nWhat may be more problematic is the possible adverse effect on the French economy. As the premium falls, the French may be more reluctant to invest outside France.

{"idx": 113, "truncated_input": "Why do CEOs need extravagant perks even when they are firing staff and pleading for taxpayer bailouts? It may just be in their makeup, experts say. It takes arrogance and narcissism to become leader of a Fortune 500 company. Those same traits, however, have become their undoing during the deepest recession in decades.\nU.S. President Barack Obama has noticed, telling reporters on Thursday he was outraged by a New York State report that $18.4 billion in Wall Street bonuses were paid in 2008 as taxpayers rescued the crumbling financial system. \"That is the height of irresponsibility. It is shameful,\" Obama said.\nNew York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is investigating Wall Street bonuses, welcomed Obama&apos;s comments. \"While Wall Street melted down, top executives believed that, unlike the rest of the country, they still deserved huge bonuses,\" Cuomo said.\nFor Bob Monks, a former executive who has written nine books on corporate governance, the reason is that the rich and powerful simply love their toys. \"It&apos;s a boy thing. Sort of, &apos;Mine&apos;s bigger than yours.&apos; It&apos;s really childish,\" said Monks, a shareholder rights activist and the subject of a book called \"A Traitor to His Class.\"\nMonks related a story about flying on someone&apos;s corporate jet. The host was devastated when, upon landing, he saw that while he planned for a limo to be waiting at the airport another captain of industry had a helicopter take him to town. \"I thought my guy was going to die. ... It&apos;s entirely about people&apos;s self-image.\"\nLongtime advocates of shareholder rights were handed a gift in November when Detroit auto executives flew to Washington on corporate jets to ask for billions of dollars in taxpayer money, sparking a public outrage.\nMore recently, it became known that former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain spent $1.2 million remodeling his office last year, including $1,405 for a trash can. Merrill Lynch is owned by Bank of America, which consumed $45 billion of taxpayer money through bailouts.\nThen on Tuesday, Citigroup canceled plans to buy a $50 million executive jet after a White House rebuke.\n\"People don&apos;t become head of Merrill Lynch without having a certain sense of self-importance. Once they arrive at that position, they have all kinds of toadies tell them what geniuses they are, then of course they begin to feel their lifelong feelings of self-importance have been confirmed,\" said Charles Goodstein, a psychoanalyst and professor at New York University School of Medicine.\nDefenders of executive perks say generous compensation is needed to retain talent. Sometimes it&apos;s jets but can also include home security systems, country club memberships, sports tickets and financial advice. The value of these benefits is considered income, so CEOs also sometimes get another perk: company help in paying their taxes. \"I was CEO of a bank once and it&apos;", "baseline_completion": "s not rocket science. You need the same skill set as somebody running a hardware store in a medium-sized town,\" Monks said.\nSteve Thel, a former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a professor at Fordham Law School, blames compliant board members who often come from the same privileged world and can get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for attending a few meetings each year. \"It&apos;s endemic to the system. The last administration didn&apos;t think there was any structural flaw. Now across the political spectrum people feel that Wall Street executive compensation is out of control,\" Thel said. He predicted Congress would pass legislation granting minority shareholders more say on pay and possibly introduce higher taxes on some parts of executive compensation. \"A year ago it was absolutely unthinkable that this would be heard in Congress,\" Thel said.", "orig_sample_length": 973, "prompt_length": 773, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "s hard to get a good tax adviser. They&apos;re all working for the other side,\" said Monks, who is also a banker.\nThe perks are often justified in terms of a \"pay for performance\" compensation structure. But critics say that is a smokescreen. \"It&apos;s not so much that they are paying for performance, it&apos;s paying for the performance of the past. It&apos;s already happened. It&apos;s done,\" said Monks.\nThe perks movement began in the 1970s and 1980s under the banner of shareholder capitalism.

{"idx": 121, "truncated_input": "Hull - Where the US goes the UK often follows. This is especially true of negatives. If the US has extreme weather we usually experience similar a few days later. If violent crime increases across the Pond likewise in the UK. Then there is shopping madness.\nThe UK is taking up traditional US activities such as Christmas shopping bargain days that leave customers with empty wallets and a range of unwanted goods.\nBlack Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each have become big shopping days on both sides of the Pond. Last Friday many people hit the shops attracted by huge price cuts and today the same is happening online. Is all as it seems though?\nAs usual the answer is probably not.\nIt is so easy to get sucked into spending unnecessarily. You buy in haste and repent at leisure. This year remember it is still in reality a consumer market. Businesses want your trade. That does not stop some of them throwing the odd rogue item into the pot.\nThis year more than ever retailers will be trying hard to get you to part with your hard-earned money. There will be pre-Christmas sales and bargains long after today. With Christmas a few weeks away perhaps it would be wiser to hang fire. Shop around, be it online or on the High Street, take your time and purchase well.\nBargains are sometimes far from that. They could be second-rate, last year's model or simply stock that is hard to shift. Once it is dressed up with a fancy cut-price sign you may find it hard to resist.\nConsider all the implications of your purchase before you buy.\n1- If you buy online there may be delivery charges but you will be saving a potentially expensive trip to town which could be full of hassle.\n2 - Emails dropping into your inbox, that offer great bargains, can be tempting. However, if you purchase an item you had no intention of buying is it really a bargain? Probably not, especially if money is tight.\nHaving some idea", "baseline_completion": "of what you want to buy helps. If you shop \"blind\" you will be more likely to spend more than you should. Online retail oulets, just like the shops, are full of goods you never knew you wanted or needed and in many cases cannot afford.\nCyber Monday also increases the temptation to buy now and pay later. Not a good idea. Pay for purchases online with a switch or debit card so you are not paying for Christmas well into the New Year or even beyond.\nOne factor specific to the UK is that this week Chancellor George Osborne will announce to the country his Autumn statement, or Budget. It is doubtful that it will have a real positive effect on retail trade but it could. It could also cost you dearly in many ways. Brits take care and look after your money this cyber Monday.\nPerhaps the rest of you would be wise to follow suit too!", "orig_sample_length": 657, "prompt_length": 457, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "of what you want to buy can help you save money.\n3 - When buying online check the details of your purchase.

If it is not quite what you wanted can you return it?\n7 - Do you know what the size of the item is?\n8 - Do you know what the colour of the item is?\n9 - If your item breaks do you know who to contact to get it repaired?\n10 - How will you pay for your item?

If not, it's time to move on.\nMany people start Christmas shopping a few weeks early. Others leave it to the last minute. In the UK the period between late November to early January is known as the 'busy season' in the retail world.\nIt is the time of the year when businesses, that have previously run into the red, can turn a profit. It may be one of the only times when they can make a profit.

And we thought we know an underserved mining area,\" Loren Nelson said.\nThese retired school teachers began Dolly's Imagination Library in Grant County with just a thousand dollars of their own money and donations from a few dozen businesses.\n\"There's great poverty. The people in Grant County can't afford to buy books,\" Nelson said. \"We know because of all kinds of research how important it is to have books in the home. And quality books, not just for reading, but the snuggle, the family bonding. And so we decided this is going to be our passion.\"\nWhile Dolly takes care of choosing and shipping the books, the local affiliates are in charge of raising the funds.", "baseline_completion": "\n\"We kind of work month-to-month-to-month, but we've been able to keep the program going,\" Nelson said.\nNow, they've expanded into 22 of New Mexico's 33 counties. 18 of those are just partial expansions, and Bernalillo County is one example of that.\n\"I only have funds to work with families that work with zip codes in 87105 and 87121. And as we raise more money we'll open up more zip codes. We're anxious to do that,\" said John Heinrich, President of Libros for Kids, Imagination Library in Bernalillo County.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the program, go to imaginationlibrary.org and you can see if your zip code participates.

{"idx": 125, "truncated_input": "While many restaurants in New York City have close relationships with farmers, and boast unimpeachable farm-to-table ethics, far fewer have actual gardens wherein they grow the produce that\u2019s used on their plates. Six great restaurants with their very own gardens follow. Call them \u201croof to table.\u201d By Jessica Allen.\nAtop a 100-year-old building in the West Village grow lettuces, bicolor squash, fennel, dill, parsley, poblano peppers, Japanese eggplant, and tomatoes, among other things, using soil-less, solar-powered hydroponic technology. Bell, Book & Candle incorporates these and other vegetables and herbs into its New American food. Being so close to the source means the chefs don\u2019t refrigerate the produce. In fact, they call the freshly grown produce \u201cdormant, not dead,\u201d since the roots are kept attached until the very last second before cooking.\nRoberta\u2019s might look like a bunker from the outside, but inside the message is all about love\u2014love of good food, love of food to create change, love of the community that comes together around good food. Behind its scruffy exterior lie terrific pizza and pasta, a radio station, a greenhouse, and a very big garden. You can see what\u2019s growing via the garden\u2019s blog, with its photos of violets, edible weeds, raspberries, basil, strawberries, watermelon, peaches, chard, and blackberries, or you can take a seat in the wooden-paneled dining room, beneath a pizza party Barbie and board games, and order whatever\u2019s just been harvested.\nLike most Westin properties around the world, the newest one in New York City features luxurious amenities like the Heavenly Bed\u00ae (definitely worth its copyright in plushness), in-room Starbucks coffee, and special velour robes. But this hotel also has its very own organic garden, 384 feet above 42nd Street, supplying veggies and herbs to The LCL: Bar & Kitchen on site. This means fresh mint for mojitos and other cocktails, heirloom tomatoes for gazpacho and other dishes, mesclun lettuce for salads, grilled squash and zucchini as seasonal sides, and everything and anything else Executive Chef Brian Wieler (pictured) can cook up.\nModeled on a shebeen, an informal dining hall, and named for Nelson Mandela, Madiba claims to be the first South African restaurant of its kind in the United States. It opened in Fort Greene in 1999. Its rooftop garden is the source of at least some of the produce on the bushman\u2019s vegetable platter (pictured), including yellow squash, asparagus, string beans, baby bok choy, corn on the cob, spinach, and fat triangles of garlic. This dish serves as a counterpart to meatastic South African braai, or barbecue, a specialty of the restaurant.\nThe people behind Brooklyn Grange, the world\u2019s largest rooftop soil farms, helped construct a much smaller one atop Rosemary\u2019s, an Italian enoteca and trattoria in the West Village. Here, on 1,700 square feet, grow peppers, radishes, arugula, basil, broccoli rabe, and all kinds of organic goodness. Picked produce arrives in the kitchen in a basket using a block and tackle", "baseline_completion": ". An actual basket! Not content with herbs and veggies, restaurateur Carlos Suarez has expanded the garden to include a chicken coop and beehive. Diners are sometimes allowed up for a peek.\nWhen chef/restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten and his partners decided to build a rooftop garden 10 stories above Broadway to supply ABC Kitchen with microgreens, herbs, and other produce, they sought out seeds from farmers at the Union Square Greenmarket. In addition to what gets harvested upstairs, the seasonal, oft-changing menu at this James Beard award-winning restaurant includes sustainable, locally sourced (when possible) meat, dairy, seafood, and produce, free of antibiotics and pesticides, along with beverages whose ingredients come from fair-trade cooperatives.", "orig_sample_length": 1031, "prompt_length": 831, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "system, and is incorporated into dishes like zucchini fritters with pesto, pea and mint risotto, and pan-roasted salmon.\nFish has never tasted quite so fresh as at the Fish Market, on the roof of the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Chelsea. In 2007, its owners began growing their own greens, but in 2012 they added a farm of their own, on the roof of their building, where they now grow everything from lettuce to kale, peppers, tomatoes, and even honey. The produce goes directly to the Fish Market\u2019s kitchen, where it can be found in salads, sandwiches, and even cocktails.", "w_wm_output": ". Chef Anthony Mazzola\u2019s dishes have included roasted radicchio over arugula pesto, and grilled asparagus with fava beans.

{"idx": 126, "truncated_input": "In the past 11 months, Mauti has had to rely on his words unlike any other time in his life. Penn State\u2019s leading tackler went from being a quiet, unquestioned leader to a harsh-talking student representative nearly overnight.\nWhen a scandal and the ensuing fallout threatened to tear apart his team, all Mauti could fight back with were his words.\nTo Penn State fans, Michael Mauti was unknown in 2008.\nHis dad, Rich, had played for the Nittany Lions and went on to his own successful run in the NFL. His brother, Patrick, was a junior on the Nittany Lions. The youngest Mauti was just the new kid \u2014 Pat\u2019s little brother \u2014 in the No. 42 jersey.\nHe introduced himself eight games into the season. With Michigan in town and threatening to take a two-possession lead at Beaver Stadium, Mauti flew down the field on kickoff coverage in the first quarter and exploded into Michigan return man Sam McGuffie.\nThe football popped free, and although the Wolverines recovered it, a psychological blow had been dealt. The packed stadium was rocking and the Penn State sideline drew sudden inspiration from Mauti\u2019s jackhammer hit.\nThe Nittany Lions then rattled off 39 unanswered points to secure a 46-17 win.\nIt took a hit of that caliber to spark a young Mauti\u2019s love of the game.\nAlthough Rich Mauti played seven seasons in the NFL, he wouldn\u2019t let his sons step on a football field until they were in seventh grade. In Michael\u2019s case, he didn\u2019t start playing until eighth grade.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the youngest Mauti to be put off by football.\nSo Mauti, the smallest kid on the team, let the season play out. Soon, an unwilling participant became the fiercest of competitors on the freshman team at Mandeville (La.) High School.\nHe started the season as a quarterback but soon found himself making plays on kickoff coverage.\nIt\u2019s not that Mauti intends to injure opponents. He plays within the rules. But he won\u2019t deny that football is a violent game and being the player to initiate contact is Mauti\u2019s specialty.\nIf an opponent remembers Mauti\u2019s number after a hit and has second thoughts about touching the football for the rest of the game, Mauti\u2019s made a huge impact by his own standards.\n\u201cThe feeling of the hit. The feeling of delivering a blow, it\u2019s just \u2014 There\u2019s something about it,\u201d Mauti said.\nIt was the worst feeling of his playing career \u2014 laying on his back on the Beaver Stadium grass, staring up at a blue sky knowing it was happening all over again.\nMauti had torn an anterior cruciate ligament before, so he knew pretty quickly when his left leg buckled during the first quarter of the 2011 Eastern Illinois game that his left leg was shot before he even hit the ground.\nAfter sutting out the entire 2009 season concentrating on rehabilitating his right knee, Mauti came back with a vengeance in 2010. He finished fifth on the team with 57 tackles.\nAn expanded on-field role would have to wait, however, following the early season injury to his left knee last season.\nMauti got luckier the second time around. When he was injured in 2009, he contracted a nasty case of strep throat. He lost nearly 30 pounds and couldn\u2019t eat normally for weeks. Last fall, Mauti was able to stay relatively healthy except for the knee injury. He was able to concentrate on healing after his surgery and took a better approach to his rehab having gone through it just months before.\nThen-defensive coordinator Tom Bradley wanted to keep his star linebacker involved with day-to-day operations. So Mauti became an extra coach, going so far as to call the majority of the defenses in the TicketCity Bowl after Bradley was promoted to interim head coach.\nIt helped having counsel from former Nittany Lions such as Jerome Hayes, Brennan Coakley and Sean Lee - who had been in Mauti\u2019s situation, battling back from knee injuries.\nBeyond two major knee injuries, Mauti has racked up the bumps and bruises one would expect of a brute who plays every snap with reckless abandon, thriving on collisions.\nMauti appeared in 11 games in 2010 and wouldn\u2019t let a sprained ankle suffered against Iowa or a separated shoulder courtesy of Ohio State to keep him away from football.\nMauti learned over a tumultuous summer that he could take on an even greater role for a squad desperately in need of vocal leader.\nWhen the NCAA came down on Penn State with a four-year bowl ban to go along with a $60 million fine and serious scholarship reductions, Mauti and teammate Michael Zordich got together with a plan to combat the NCAA\u2019s harshest penalty.\nThe sanctions gave any Penn State player a free chance to transfer out of the program without giving up a year of eligibility. Some chose to do just that, and other college programs began contacting Penn State players, some even coming to campus on recruiting trips.\nMauti and Zordich took it personally. The duo made their way to Coach Bill O\u2019Brien after the NCAA penalties were announced, and the next day made a statement outside of the team\u2019s practice complex that Penn State players would stick together.\nFor the most part, the Nittany Lions have.\nMauti said he was honored to eulogize Joe Paterno at a memorial service following the longtime coach\u2019s death in January. Speaking last in a line of players, each representing a decade Paterno in which coached, Mauti took to the lectern in the Bryce Jordan Center with no notes and spoke from the heart.\nHe told the story of his initial recruitment. Mauti\u2019s family didn\u2019t expect him to commit on the spot to Paterno, but that\u2019s what happened. Mauti remembered Paterno giving him flack for getting kicked out of a drill for fighting as a freshman.\n\u201c\u2018Hey, your dad used to act like he was tough, too, trying to fight people all the time,\u2019\u201d Mauti said in his best high-pitched impression of Paterno.\nPat Fitzgerald\u2019s eyes are trained to watch football and immediately evaluate.\nWhen the Northwestern coach dissects an opposing team\u2019s defense, his eyes go to the linebackers first. Fitzgerald, himself a college football hall of famer who played the position, sees no weaknesses in Mauti\u2019s game.\nMauti won\u2019t dwell on his past. He won\u2019t allow the fear of being injured to creep into his mind.\nHe won\u2019t let the negative white noise, the criticism of his team or school by outside talking heads, distract him. Like he did this summer, when other coaches were on Penn State\u2019s campus, looking to lure Nittany Lion players way, Mauti will give them an earful. He\u2019ll do everything in his", "baseline_completion": "power to keep opposing coaches away.\nIf that means he has to talk, so be it. Mauti said he would rather hit someone between the sidelines.\nHe\u2019ll throw himself into Northwestern players with explosive zeal. He\u2019ll get up off the pile of players and high step his way back to the Penn State sideline.\nMimicking his big-hit celebration at his seat in the Lasch Football Building, Mauti bounces both of his legs simultaneously so his knees come up above the table where he\u2019s sitting.\nMauti\u2019s presence is heavily requested these days. He does this interview, then he\u2019s got to get going.\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose, man,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just playing every play like it\u2019s my last.\n\u201cFor all I know it could be taken away on any play.", "orig_sample_length": 1905, "prompt_length": 1705, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "power to ensure that the Nittany Lions stick together.\nThis summer, Mauti has his eyes set on earning a captain\u2019s spot for the 2013 season.\nHe\u2019ll take it one step further and be a leader on and off the field, one that Penn State can be proud of.\nNote: The Lions\u2019 Walk is a series that examines Penn State\u2019s 2012 team in terms of the players\u2019 backgrounds and their relationships with each other.

{"idx": 128, "truncated_input": "The FINANCIAL (AD) -- ProCredit Bank has donated a unique ex libris collection to the National Centre of Manuscripts. This donation was part of a project jointly initiated by the National Centre of Manuscripts and ProCredit Bank, in which the Bank bought a unique collection of ex librises from a private individual living in Thessaloniki, Greece.\nMany of the graphic images on the ex librises were the work of Georgian painters, so their donation to the National Centre of Manuscripts is a very important contribution to preserving the heritage of Georgian manuscripts. They carry additional information about the life and creative work of Georgia\u2019s artists and important public figures.\n\u201cFrom ProCredit Bank\u2019s side we are extremely delighted to have had the chance to support Georgia\u2019s culture and inheritance of manuscripts. It\u2019s extremely rewarding to have had the chance to hand over this unique and interesting collection of ex librises to the National Centre of Manuscripts; that we had the opportunity to obtain these very interesting examples of Georgian culture and history. By handing this collection today to the National Centre of Manuscripts we also, one more time, want to demonstrate our support for the development of Georgian culture. All in all I think it\u2019s a very promising beginning for a hopefully fruitful and long-lasting relationship with the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\n\u201cIn the National Centre of Manuscripts there are manuscripts, historical documents, archival materials and library collections. This is one of the largest collections across the country. It has been gathering material and growing since the 19th century; this process is still ongoing and will never be finished. The collection has mainly grown from people\u2019s donations, except for a few exceptions. Over the years we received donations from individuals, families, from private companies, public and private organizations. And the result is a unique collection which is now protected by the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d he added.\n\u201cToday, one of the priorities for us is searching for new materials and continuing the pursuit of our great ancestors, who began collecting such materials in the 19th century. We also have another sub-priority, as just like this material was found in a foreign country, great care is needed not to lose Georgia-related materials that may be located abroad. They shouldn\u2019t fall into someone else\u2019s hands, in some cases private collectors. Then the trace will be lost,\u201d Buba Kudava said.\n\u201cWe were searching over the internet with our colleagues for information of this sort, and we managed to connect with an individual in Thessaloniki, Greece. We asked them to send us information on a regular basis about Georgia-related materials. And indeed they sent us the ex libris collection and when we showed this material to experts, it turned out to be very interesting. There are many famous figures associated with these ex librises. On the one hand, one part of this collection was designed by well-known artists. The second part is known because it is created for famous statesmen, but by a lesser-known Georgian painter. The first is the Elene Akhvlediani ex libris, the second is the Sergo Kobuladze ex libris. We did not have a separate collection of ex librises until now. Of course there are", "baseline_completion": "such materials in archives and in books, but so far we have not had such an amount of ex librises,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEx librises were invented along with book printing and were an integral part of a book through the ages. Today, some of them are considered works of art. That is why participation in such a project is very important for ProCredit Bank, and we are very pleased that this unique ex libris collection has been added to the heritage of Georgian manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\nThe term \u201cex libris\u201d is Latin for \u201cfrom the library of\u201d, and is used to describe a printed label on the inside front cover of a book indicating the name of the owner. In the past, ex librises often took the form of a drawing, an emblem or an illustration of some famous event, sometimes by a famous artist.", "orig_sample_length": 963, "prompt_length": 763, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "some ex librises in our holdings, but they are scattered in different locations.

{"idx": 129, "truncated_input": "\"Oh, you are stuck on homework problem number 13? I found a solution on YouTube. That helped a lot. Just Google it, you can find all the solutions.\"\nThe second problem is partially my fault. When I give an in-class assessment, I leave the solution out on the front desk so that students can check their answers when they are finished. Instead of studying this and figuring out their mistakes, students will usually just take a quick picture of the solutions using their phone. Of course they ask if it's OK to take a snapshot first, and I let them. However, the problem is that they think of the solution as something to collect rather than something to learn from.\nConfusion is the sweat of learning.\nYou can't just google a physics solution and expect to learn. Imagine if Luke Skywalker had access to the Internet on Dagobah. Here's what would have happened when his x-wing sunk beneath the water.\nYoda: So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Do you nothing that I say?\nLuke: Master moving stones around is one thing, but this is entirely different. But let me just Google \"how to lift an x-wing with the Force.\" Ah. Here it is.\nOf course that's not what happened (I would make this alternate scene into a comic if I could actually draw). Luke learned about the Force by failing. Yes, students learn physics by working on problems and by failing to solve problems. It's the journey to the solution that's important, not the solution itself. Using a video solution would be like using a golf cart to run 5 miles. Sure, you end up in the same place if you run or ride\u2014but they do not produce the same results.\nBut why do students think this? Why do they think learning is as simple as quick search or a photo with their smart phone? There are likely many reasons for students to hold these learning beliefs. However, I popular media often doesn't help. Remember this scene from The Avengers?\nSHIELD agent Maria Hill asks Tony Stark: \"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\" Stark's answer: \"Last night\". This shows that Tony Stark is so awesome he just figured astrophysics out last night. Clearly, students feel that you have to be a special superhero to understand astrophysics. You either get it in one night, or you'll never get it. I would prefer to have Stark say \"", "baseline_completion": "Well, I've been working in this field for 10 years and I'm just scratching the surface.\" Maybe that wouldn't fit too well in the movie.\nOr here's another good one from Days of Thunder.\nCole pulls up to the race track to test out a stock car.\nHarry Hogge: What do you know about stock car racing?\nCole Trickle: Well... watched it on television, of course.\nHarry Hogge: You've seen it on television?\nCole Trickle: ESPN. The coverage is excellent, you'd be surprised at how much you can pick up.\nHarry Hogge: I'm sure I would.\nSee. Learning is simple. You just need to watch some videos and you'll be all set\u2014except when you aren't. Nope. Learning is tough, but it's totally worth it.", "orig_sample_length": 746, "prompt_length": 546, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "I'm not an astrophysicist, but I can teach you some basics about the Sun.\"\nI'm not saying that a YouTube video or a demonstration are bad things. I'm saying that students should not think that learning is the same as watching a video. In fact, here is a YouTube video where I demonstrate the conservation of momentum for a car crash.\nStudents expect a video to show a clear, simple explanation of the problem. In reality, the video shows the problem, but also shows my struggle in explaining it. The students can see that learning is not as easy as jumping into a YouTube video.\nWhat do you think? How do you think YouTube affects student learning?\nSubscribe to my mailing list for weekly posts and a free ebook.", "w_wm_output": "I was stuck on a physics problem and I Googled the answer. I'll admit that sometimes the answer was wrong, but I think that's the beauty of science. You have to try something, and then if it doesn't work you have to try something else. And the process of working through the problem and getting the final result is a beautiful thing. It's the beauty of science.\"\nI don't want to blame the students. As a teacher who wants to teach good science and good pedagogy, I'm partly to blame. I have taught the problem solving strategies and I have told students that we learn from mistakes.

{"idx": 130, "truncated_input": "These two healthcare REITs are trading for dirt-cheap valuations despite high dividends and a solid history of growth.\nInvesting in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, is one of the best ways to enjoy high dividends and the potential for capital growth. On a valuation basis, REITs specializing in healthcare properties are trading cheaply right now, and two seem to be a particularly good bargain: HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW).\nThis type of real estate should be an excellent long-term investment for three main reasons: demographics, increased healthcare spending, and market opportunity.\nDemographics indicate a growing demand for healthcare properties over the coming decades. Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification. This way, if one market faces headwinds (say, the U.S.), it won't represent virtually all of Medical Properties' assets.\nThe company does have a relatively high debt load for a REIT: Debt represents 51.6% of Medical Properties' assets, so there's added risk to consider. However, 98% of the portfolio's leases have annual rent increases built in, and the company's payout ratio is less than two-thirds of FFO -- lower than that of most peers.\nIn short, there's no reason to believe Medical Properties Trust will have any debt-related issues going forward, with a", "baseline_completion": "growing stream of income that's already more than enough to cover the dividend.\nNote: Share prices and guidance are current as of 5/23/16. Normalized or adjusted FFO guidance is used when available.\nNo stock with double-digit growth potential is without risk, and these two are certainly no exception. In fact, a higher level of perceived risk is responsible for the low valuations. Healthcare spending could slow, operating partners could face greater financial difficulties, or there could be a shortage of attractive acquisition opportunities in the target property types. Any one of these factors could cause these stocks to take a dive.\nHowever, I think the growth potential and the solid track record of delivering profits in a variety of economic climates more than make up for the risks. Either of these healthcare REITs would make a solid addition to a well-diversified dividend growth portfolio.", "orig_sample_length": 1174, "prompt_length": 974, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "healthy balance sheet and a conservative financial strategy.\nMost of the company's properties are leased on a triple-net basis, meaning the tenant is responsible for property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and capital improvements. This structure reduces some of the operational risk that comes from owning a property, as it shifts responsibility from the landlord to the tenant.\nFurthermore, the company's partners have an impressive track record of growing hospital beds. Since 2011, the company has grown its portfolio by 200% on a same-store basis.\nHCP and Medical Properties Trust both specialize in healthcare real estate, and they both own very cheap assets with a history of growth and high yields. If there's a drawback to either company, it's the high debt load, which could present a potential risk in the future.\nHowever, both companies are", "w_wm_output": "conservative balance sheet to boot.\nHCP's valuation is particularly compelling at the moment. In the first quarter, the company's FFO was $0.44 per share, and the stock is trading at just under $25. That means the company's market cap is only $14.4 billion. Even if you add the value of the assets being spun off, the market cap only gets to $15.3 billion.

{"idx": 133, "truncated_input": "It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, crumbling into something tiresome and tedious.\nWhere the science-fiction genre is concerned, it\u2019s not hard to at the very least appreciate the ambition of the storytelling. It takes an honest, extra layer of creativity to create a reality not bound by the restrictions of our own, and it can be a delight to watch a perfect mixture of detailed universe building mesh with smart, unique storytelling. Of course, this requires delicate balance, as a dip too far one way finds a convoluted mess, and a dip in the opposite direction creates something that ultimately feels hollow and incomplete. It is sadly the former trap to which Andy and Lana Wachowski\u2019s Jupiter Ascending falls victim.\nIn a similar vein to what they were able to accomplish with previous sci-fi stories like The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending is a narrative set in a vivid and comprehensive world. There are legions of soldiers who have had their DNA spliced with animals \u2013 like the wolf-infused Caine (Channing Tatum) or the bee-like Stinger (Sean Bean). There are galaxy-spanning businesses where worlds are held like long-term investments. There\u2019s even intergalactic low-level bureaucracy that has all varieties of individuals waiting in lines and shuffling from one department to the next. It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and at times funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, eventually crumbling into something tiresome and tedious \u2013 albeit consistently beautiful.\nThe Wachowskis do legitimately make good choices in the casting department, as both Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum make for fun, charismatic leads to take us through the story. Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, an illegal alien living with her Russian immigrant family and working as a housekeeper living in modern day Chicago. As we see happen oh so often at the cinema, however, her life changes in an instant when she meets Caine (Tatum), an intergalactic bounty hunter. Jupiter is not only made aware of life on other planets, but also that she is the genetic recurrence of one of the most powerful women in the galaxy, and stands to literally inherent the Earth now that she has passed away. It\u2019s a simple and rather familiar plot, but through a first act of enjoyable \u201cawakening\u201d material and sky-shredding action scenes, Jupiter Ascending holds its own.\nIt\u2019s with the introduction of the trio of central villains that everything begins to fall apart \u2013 which is a sincere problem considering that they wind up completely driving the entire story. These are the three surviving members of the Abrasax family -- Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) \u2013 and the sons and daughter of the woman whom Jupiter Jones is a genetic equal. Each of them has a personal desire to take control of the Earth \u2013 which is alternately described as being extremely valuable and just a single piece of a much larger business \u2013 but also each take their own place doing more harm to the movie than good. Kalique winds up being mostly useless to the story, simply providing huge amounts of exposition and then disappearing; Titus merely feels like a stall in the narrative, serving as what is really a fairly pointless obstacle; and Balem simply feels overcooked in every sense, with Redmayne giving a highly bizarre, scenery-chewing performance full of needless affectation that makes him stick out like a sore thumb (really making you wonder what kind of off-base directions he was being given by the Wachowskis). As Jupiter Ascending\u2019s plot encounters these characters, the film begins to degrade faster and faster, exploring needless and unnecessary elements of the sci-fi world that do more subtraction than addition.\nAt this point in their careers, Andy and Lana Wachowski have become better known for their visual flash and style, and it serves the movie well. Their flair is apparent from the costume and makeup work (the idea of DNA splicing works magic in this department) to the production design, and it all serves to provide Jupiter Ascending with a unique feel (even when it wears references to movies like Brazil on its sleeve). Immense credit also goes to the visual effects teams, who not only render some fantastic air battles and spaceships, but also expansive alien environments that do their", "baseline_completion": "part to make the audience feel like they\u2019re being taken to a different world. All of this spectacle doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that character motivations are at times completely dubious, and that the third act drags on far too long, but it does help.\nIt\u2019s hard to really begrudge a film like Jupiter Ascending, both for its creative scope and in that it is one of the few-and-far-between female-led action movies, but it is equally hard to validate it beyond those elements, it\u2019s aesthetics, and the casting of the leads. There is perhaps a better feature that exists partially on the cutting room floor \u2013 explaining some of the more bizarre plot developments/holes \u2013 or one that could have been made with just a few tweaks to the screenplay. But the movie that will be hitting theaters this week is best described as unfortunate.", "orig_sample_length": 1262, "prompt_length": 1062, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "best to stretch the imagination.\nThe Wachowskis have a clear love for the realm of sci-fi, and Jupiter Ascending is proof that it\u2019s a genre they can also do well.

It\u2019s also a shame considering that the film\u2019s central idea of a Chosen One being forced to battle for their life as well as world has so much potential. Jupiter Ascending is a good-looking film that could have done with some serious revisions in the writing department, as it never quite gets the balance of character and storyline right. As a result Jupiter Ascending is not a terrible film by any means, but this is a prime example of a film where all the elements just don\u2019t quite add up to make the whole worthwhile.\nJupiter Ascending is a good-looking film that could have done with", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.6179842352867126, 0.3953588604927063, 0.9515504837036133, 0.843893826007843, 0.9336661100387573, 0.7147034406661987, 0.8913812637329102, 0.4956231713294983, 0.6406650543212891, 0.9542984962463379, 0.8417999744415283, 0.8248759508132935, 0.3517267405986786, 0.7974309921264648, 0.40924015641212463, 0.41562315821647644, 0.8707348108291626, 0.9320626258850098, 0.36467233300209045, 0.39750200510025024, 0.8913158178329468, 0.949084997177124, 0.3525725305080414, 0.4035258889198303, 0.354533851146698, 0.35221627354621887, 0.8384050130844116, 0.9578930139541626, 0.9004858732223511, 0.8696377873420715, 0.9426648616790771, 0.8799800872802734, 0.9609464406967163, 0.6107065677642822, 0.9501327872276306, 0.4553099274635315, 0.7082499265670776, 0.8851417303085327, 0.8541463613510132, 0.6999050378799438, 0.7521802186965942, 0.8280205130577087, 0.9241430163383484, 0.35223129391670227, 0.9500020146369934, 0.4328879714012146, 0.935571551322937, 0.7199699878692627, 0.9446952939033508, 0.36882346868515015, 0.8110730648040771, 0.7063350677490234, 0.4943668842315674, 0.9138767719268799, 0.37171268463134766, 0.6900436282157898, 0.8807803392410278, 0.5835608839988708, 0.9144611358642578, 0.9263105392456055, 0.9129186868667603, 0.44227135181427, 0.9553160071372986, 0.7363052368164062, 0.9168339967727661, 0.6863506436347961, 0.3522958755493164, 0.898666501045227, 0.8497992753982544, 0.8965831398963928, 0.6286253333091736, 0.67365962266922, 0.8111580610275269, 0.9248837232589722, 0.8997282981872559, 0.35159483551979065, 0.9830118417739868, 0.9375534653663635, 0.767829418182373, 0.886235237121582, 0.9127581715583801, 0.35211506485939026, 0.3648853302001953, 0.922823965549469, 0.9649066925048828, 0.526179313659668, 0.9325134754180908, 0.8875293731689453, 0.8215800523757935, 0.9122523665428162, 0.8674187660217285, 0.8127589225769043, 0.36176520586013794, 0.7410721778869629, 0.8259807229042053, 0.8585619926452637, 0.41199174523353577, 0.5299811363220215, 0.754417896270752, 0.9145746827125549, 0.35160815715789795, 0.41413918137550354, 0.35166242718696594, 0.35158395767211914, 0.903834342956543, 0.9150564670562744, 0.9368652105331421, 0.8134703636169434, 0.3916662931442261, 0.7725133895874023, 0.7073344588279724, 0.9332759380340576, 0.5650907754898071, 0.6809160113334656, 0.7487560510635376, 0.6847896575927734, 0.9058723449707031, 0.8999751210212708, 0.41883984208106995, 0.7953886389732361, 0.6077876687049866, 0.7445316314697266, 0.6086054444313049, 0.6635037660598755, 0.7904819250106812, 0.7581566572189331, 0.9123042225837708, 0.6837998628616333, 0.9202582240104675, 0.8790134191513062, 0.8673296570777893, 0.7163122892379761, 0.9555345177650452, 0.7327409982681274, 0.8377254605293274, 0.8286572694778442, 0.7730250358581543, 0.6195288300514221, 0.7878332734107971, 0.7652665376663208, 0.5940539240837097, 0.4019613265991211, 0.35169050097465515, 0.3875425159931183, 0.35166504979133606, 0.3529016673564911, 0.8330501914024353, 0.8291479349136353, 0.8088515996932983, 0.8576344847679138, 0.6048363447189331, 0.5765337944030762, 0.36475658416748047, 0.4965728223323822, 0.48504531383514404, 0.4968910813331604, 0.6475650072097778, 0.7845548987388611, 0.8556029796600342, 0.93443363904953, 0.39998477697372437, 0.4011150300502777, 0.809273362159729, 0.8335949182510376, 0.6703025698661804, 0.8078668713569641, 0.6144329905509949, 0.8911341428756714, 0.7848248481750488, 0.7161904573440552, 0.373183935880661, 0.3515692353248596, 0.7476832866668701, 0.7952573299407959, 0.35795465111732483, 0.6381385326385498, 0.8268152475357056, 0.7711371183395386, 0.6888805031776428, 0.8609191179275513, 0.7115189433097839, 0.44502493739128113, 0.5838485360145569, 0.8245776891708374, 0.36161962151527405, 0.35177332162857056, 0.3570965826511383, 0.3515746295452118, 0.3517463803291321, 0.7518824338912964, 0.8134077787399292, 0.8466320037841797, 0.40264037251472473, 0.3520525395870209, 0.47302722930908203, 0.45719224214553833, 0.4140472710132599, 0.3559497892856598, 0.3662252426147461, 0.35429346561431885]}
{"idx": 134, "truncated_input": "For a career that once seemed so good on paper, the crisis in teacher recruitment is now hardly ever out of the news.\nThere are not enough people signing up to become teachers and too many are dropping out - some experienced due to the stress and increase in workload but often the newly qualified leave the profession, unprepared for the life in the classroom.\nSchool lead Andrew Truby, a national leader of education, is determined to change the narrative about teaching as a profession.\nHe feels school leaders have it in their gift to change this situation on the ground by making brave decisions and by investing in the professional culture so that schools become irresistible places to work.\nAt St Thomas of Canterbury School, in Meadowhead, where Mr Truby is executive headteacher, there is a 100 per cent school-based teacher training school which is going from strength-to-strength.\nThe outstanding Ofsted-rated school became a teaching school in 2015, and works with partner schools in the Learning Unlimited Teaching School Alliance.\nThe alliance, based in a modern training facility at the school, takes on School Direct trainees on a year-long programme.\nEach student is placed in one of 14 partner schools across Sheffield, Doncaster and Chesterfield for the entire programme, where they will work for a year alongside outstanding and primary class teachers.\nTeaching school manager, Anita Bray, said: \"The beauty of this course is that trainee teachers are based in a school for the whole programme.\n\"They encounter children and liaise with parents. They do things like parents evening - all the nitty gritty.\n\"The trainee teachers have been there and have done it, they have had that experience which is much different from doing it in classrooms.\"\nDuring the course, students spend time in another of the partner schools so they get to experience life in two schools.\nThey are given a mentor who, at first, they observe, then plan lessons alongside before the mentor oversees the trainee teacher planning and delivering the lessons.\nThe trainee teachers meet once a week at the School Direct hub session for training, with specialist leaders of education or subject specialists coming in to take sessions.\nTeaching school director, Sarah Rockliff, described the process as 'learning by doing'.\nShe said: \"Trainee teachers are in classrooms and they are coming to hub sessions and picking up ideas about teaching and learning and then the next day they get the chance to put that into practice.\n\"Teaching is a craft and the only way to become a master of your craft is to keep practising it.\"\nShe added: \"After only a few weeks the trainees start to refer to their partner school as 'my school' and they feel a real connection to the school they are working in and are invested in the children. That adds to the motivation.\n\"It's a hard course and requires a lot of hard work.\"\nThe alliance was established in 2015 and the first cohort of students all gained jobs after completing the course.\nTrainees come from a variety of backgrounds, some have been teaching assistants or involved in education, while others are looking for a career change.\nTrainee teacher Nick Walker, aged 31, taught English abroad before returning to England to further his career.\nHe said: \"I have been teaching for five years already and I thought it would be beneficial to me to be in a hands-on situation and seeing what it was like day-today.\n\"I was at university 10 years ago. I wanted to carry on learning and this feels like a job whereas if I'd gone back to university it would have felt like a step backwards.\"\nFormer secondary school teaching assistant Kirsty Norris, 25, said: \"You see the reality of life in a school. You experience parents' evening and when sometimes your lessons plans just don't work.\n\"It's hard work but you know that next year it will all be worth it.\"\nMr Truby, who is strategic lead for the alliance, said recruiting teachers ready for the classroom had been a challenge in the past.\n\"Recruitment of high quality teachers is an ongoing challenge for schools and in the past the newly qualified teachers who we did appoint were not ready for the classroom,\" he said.\n\"Through our 100 per cent school-based teacher training route, our School Direct trainee teachers experience the full school year in a primary school.\n\"When", "baseline_completion": "they start in their NQT year, they are confident in subject knowledge, planning, marking, assessment as well as knowing how the school works throughout the year.\"\nHe felt the perception around teaching needed to change because it is 'the best job in the world'.\nHe added: \"Although teaching as a career gets a really bad press and there is a lot of talk about workload, we believe that the schools who invest in their culture will have an easier job recruiting and retaining the best teachers.\n\"We spend time making our schools a positive place to work because happier teachers mean happier children.\n\"It is time to change the narrative about this profession because we believe that teaching is the best job in the world.\"\nThe alliance is still recruiting trainees for September when it will start two new programmes. In addition to general primary, there will be a primary with maths and an early years route.", "orig_sample_length": 1212, "prompt_length": 1012, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "they return to their training school, they will have developed the skills, knowledge and understanding to become outstanding teachers.\"\nThe school's PGCE route is set to expand to take in 20 trainee teachers next year.\nAnita Bray said: \"It's a really exciting time for us. It's a really good quality course and the staff are passionate.\"", "w_wm_output": "they become part of the alliance's School Direct cohort, they have the benefit of a school-based mentor throughout the year, and the alliance's subject specialist leaders of education coming into the classroom to support them in lesson planning.\n\"This, and the alliance's 'learning by doing' approach, means that the newly qualified teacher is working alongside the outstanding teachers in the alliance's schools right from the outset.\"\n\"We have had very high levels of success in the alliance's School Direct cohort, with 100 per cent of our trainees being offered teaching posts, and 90 per cent staying in the alliance's schools after the first year of teaching.\n\"We are committed to making a difference

{"idx": 137, "truncated_input": "Anna C. Christensen has been a supporter of family planning since high school, when she stuffed envelopes as a volunteer at a Planned Parenthood affiliate in California. Now a Tucson resident, she continues to advocate for reproductive rights and sexual health.\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona serves more than 100,000 families every year; maybe your family is one of them.\nTucson is home to the Margaret Sanger Health Center, namesake of Planned Parenthood's founder. A century ago, Margaret Sanger was a New York City nurse who witnessed the horrors of women dying prematurely after having too many children, while others died from botched abortions. This experience motivated her to become an activist for the availability and legality of contraception. Sanger was a controversial figure\u2014and that controversy lingers to this day.\nSanger first visited Tucson in the 1930s, when she helped set up the Tucson Mother's Health Clinic (also called Clinica Para las Madres), Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona's precursor. Sanger, bedeviled by health problems, was drawn by Tucson's climate. Her husband was drawn by Arizona's lack of income tax, and in 1933, they purchased an adobe house in the foothills.\nIn the early '40s, Sanger and her husband moved closer to the city's heart, as gasoline rations dulled suburbia's attractiveness. They moved into a house on Elm Street, just east of the Arizona Inn. Before his death, her husband obtained an empty lot on Sierra Vista Drive, a stone's throw from their Elm Street residence. Sanger's son Stuart built a house on one side, and Sanger decided to build her dream home on the other.\nSanger's homes hosted lavish parties as well as fundraisers for organizations like Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona and the Tucson Medical Center (of which she was also a co-founder). She took up hobbies such as cooking and watercolor; today, many of her original paintings adorn the walls of Planned Parenthood administrative headquarters in Tucson, the building that was named in her honor.\nPlanned Parenthood, in Arizona and nationwide, is currently under attack. Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to do away with Title X, a national program providing preventive health care to low-income patients; the fate of Title X is now in the Senate's hands. Since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed it into law, it has helped millions of women access services such as contraception, preventing an estimated 973,000 unintended pregnancies and 406,000 abortions every year.\nRep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), meanwhile, seeks to interfere with services covered by private insurance. By cutting off federal funds for insurance companies that cover abortions\u2014even when the tax dollars aren't put toward abortion coverage\u2014his bill would deny women the legal right to an abortion, guaranteed by the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. It would also impose tax penalties on those whose insurance offers such coverage.\nIn Arizona, families are facing further potential threats as the Republican-controlled Legislature introduced several anti-women's-health initiatives this year. HB 2384 would make Planned Parenthood newly ineligible for the Arizona Working Poor Tax Credit. HB 2416 would cause additional obstacles to abortion access, including changing the definition of \"surgical abortion\" to", "baseline_completion": "include abortion by pill, which could cut off rural women from abortion services. HB 2443 would infringe upon patient privacy by denying care to women who refuse to disclose the reasons behind their decision to abort.\nA century ago, Margaret Sanger witnessed tragedies that resulted from unintended pregnancies. In response, she illegally smuggled diaphragms into the country and opened family-planning clinics in defiance of the law\u2014and spent time in jail for her troubles. This is the world Sanger and other birth-control activists came from, and it's the world lawmakers are trying to bring back.\nDon't stand for it.

HB 2407 would require abortion providers to report their \"adverse events\" to the Arizona Department of Health Services within 10 days.\nMeanwhile, the state continues to bully Planned Parenthood. In 2011, the Arizona Legislature passed a bill prohibiting Planned Parenthood from participating in the state's Medicaid program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. The state argued that this was needed because Planned Parenthood performed abortions, and Medicaid pays for abortions. Planned Parenthood was able to negotiate a temporary stay, but the case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nSome Arizona lawmakers are also seeking to defund Planned Parenthood at the local level.

{"idx": 138, "truncated_input": "The Las Vegas real estate market got a small reprieve in February; with sales volume at a four-year high for the month and a dip in foreclosure resales helping prices increase slightly from January. A total of 3,698 new and existing houses and condos were sold in the Las Vegas-Paradise metro area in February, according to MDA DataQuick. That\u2019s up 9.8% from January and 10.5% from one year ago. A 5.7% increase from January to February is the average, dating back to 1994, DataQuick said. The February 2010 total was the highest for the month since 2006, when 6,065 homes were sold, but 2% below the 16-year average February sales total. It\u2019s the 18th straight month that total sales rose year-over-year. Existing home sales totaled 3,311, up 7.1% from January and up 9.5% from last year. It\u2019s the highest total for February existing sales since 2005. Existing home sales are on a 22-month-long run of monthly year-over-year increases. Foreclosure resales accounted for 59.6% of all resales in February, down from 62% in January and down from 70.6% last year. After peaking in April 2009 at 73.7%, foreclosure resales have declined every month. While foreclosure resales were down, foreclosure proceedings were up. In February, 1,756 homes and condos were foreclosed on in Las Vegas, up 5.3% from January, but down 52.8% from 3,718 foreclosures last year. New home sales totaled 387 in February, up 40% from January and up 20.2% from last year, but it was one of the slowest February sales totals in DataQuick\u2019s 16 years of records, second only to last year. The decline in foreclosure resales and the increase in new home sales helped the median price increase from January, but only slightly. The median price paid for all new and resale houses and condos sold in the Las Vegas metro area in February was $126,197, up 0.4% from $125,750 in January but down 17.2% from $152,500 a year earlier. DataQuick said the year-over-year decline was the smallest since March 2008, when the median dropped 16% from a year earlier, to $247,925. In addition, sales of homes over $200,000 made up 22.4% of total sales, up from 21.3% in January but down from 30.8% a year earlier. The median sales price is on a 34-month-long run of monthly year-over-year declines and in February 2010, was 59.6% below the peak median of $312,000 in November 2006. The median price for single-family homes was $133,800 in February, down from $135,000 in January and down from $157,000 last year.

He was batting .299 this year with 7 homers and 43 RBI.\nThroughout the last couple of seasons, Jesse Winker dealt with pain his right shoulder.\nAfter he felt more pain Monday, it was determined that Winker would need surgery to repair his shoulder. He will miss the remainder of the season.\nThe Reds placed Winker on the 10-day disabled list Thursday with a right shoulder subluxation.\n\"Man, I have no idea it is,\" said Winker. \"I know my shoulder hurts. That\u2019s all I know.\"\nWinker said the pain was \"off and on\" all season but Monday was essentially the final straw.\nOn first base during a comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Winker ducked under a line-drive single from Tucker Barnhart in the ninth inning and fell to the ground on the base paths. Winker later scored the game-winning run.\nA potential Rookie of the Year candidate, Winker was batting .299 this season with seven homers and 43 RBI. The outfielder ranked fourth in the Majors with a .405 on-base percentage. He had more walks (49) than strikeouts (46).\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Winker was emotional about the end of his season.\n\"Obviously, I was hoping that surgery wasn\u2019t the end result but I\u2019ve been dealing with this for 2-3 years,\" Winker said. \"Just got to the point now where it\u2019s time to go fix it.\"\nIt's a tough loss for the Reds' lineup, which was already without outfielder Scott Schebler. On the DL, Schebler began a rehab assignment Wednesday, going 1-for-3 with a walk as a designated hitter at Triple-A Louisville.\nWinker, based on what he's been told from doctors, said his goal is to return by Feb. 1, 2019. He said he felt the pain when he completed \"any baseball move.\"\n\"There were times where it affected his swing,\" Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman said. \"He altered his swing path because of the pain. That\u2019s a tough way to play at the Major League level. He did a heck of a job. I don\u2019t think anybody realized that he was going through it as much as he was.\"\nMason Williams, an outfielder at Louisville, was called up to fill Winker\u2019s roster spot. Williams played in 25 games with the New York Yankees over the past three seasons.\nA left-handed hitter, Williams signed with the Reds as a minor league free agent last offseason.\nWilliams was batting .280 with six homers and 30 RBI in 87 games at Louisville. He recorded a hit in 13 of his last 14 games.\n\"It\u2019s been a matter of me being healthy and staying on the field and playing my game and just having confidence in myself,\" Williams said.\nWilliams, once considered the Yankees' top prospect, learned of his promotion to the big leagues Thursday morning.\nHe played on the same high school team in Florida as Cardinals pitcher Austin Gomber, who", "baseline_completion": "had a no-hitter against the Reds for six innings Tuesday. The two players will sometimes train together in the offseason.\nTo make room on the 40-man roster for Williams, the Reds moved injured infielder Alex Blandino (torn ACL in his right knee) to the 60-day DL.\n\"He\u2019s had productive at-bats, competitive at-bats, against both left-and-right-handed pitching,\" Riggleman said of Williams. \"He\u2019s a good athlete. We\u2019re confident he will come up here and do a good job.\"\nSCHEBLER STILL PROGRESSING: Schebler was in Louisville's lineup as a designated hitter for his second rehab game Thursday.\nBut the key to his return will be when he's comfortable making throws.", "orig_sample_length": 990, "prompt_length": 790, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "also was called up Thursday.\nThe Reds also recalled reliever Jared Hughes from Triple-A Louisville.\nHughes made 11 relief appearances with the big-league club this season, posting a 5.40 ERA.

{"idx": 140, "truncated_input": "Rafael Nadal became the first man to win eight titles at the same Grand Slam tournament after beating fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in the French Open final on Sunday.\nIf Rafael Nadal truly was going to be challenged, if his bid for an unprecedented eighth French Open championship would be slowed even a bit, this might have been the moment.\nLeading by a set and a break 70 minutes into Sunday's final against David Ferrer, another generally indefatigable Spaniard, Nadal faced four break points in one game. The last was a 31-stroke exchange, the match's longest, capped when Nadal absorbed Ferrer's strong backhand approach and transformed it into a cross-court backhand passing shot.\nFerrer glared at the ball as it flew past and landed in a corner, then smiled ruefully. What else was there to do? Dealing with Nadal's defence-to-offence on red clay is a thankless task. His rain-soaked 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Ferrer on was Nadal's record 59th win in 60 matches at the French Open and made him the only man with eight titles at any Grand Slam tournament.\n\"I never like to compare years, but it's true that this year means something very special for me,\" Nadal said, alluding to the way he managed to come back from a left knee injury that sidelined him for about seven months.\n\"When you have a period of time like I had,\" he added, \"you realize that you don't know if you will have the chance to be back here with this trophy another time.\"\nBut he does it, year after year.\nHe won four French Opens in a row from 2005-08, and another four in a row from 2010-13.\n\"Rafael was better than me,\" said Ferrer, who had won all 18 sets he'd played the past two weeks to reach his first Grand Slam final at age 31. \"He didn't make mistakes.\"\nA week past his 27th birthday, Nadal now owns 12 major trophies in all \u2014 including two from Wimbledon, one each from the U.S. Open and Australian Open \u2014 to eclipse Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver and equal Roy Emerson for the third-most in history. Nadal trails only Roger Federer's 17 and Pete Sampras' 14.\n\"Winning 17 Grand Slam titles, that's miles away,\" Nadal said with his typical humility. \"I'm not even thinking about it.\"\nThis was Nadal's first major tournament after a surprising second-round loss at Wimbledon last June. Since rejoining the tour in February, he is 43-2 with seven titles and two runner-up finishes. He's won his past 22 matches.\n\"For me, it's incredible,\" said Toni Nadal, Rafael's uncle and coach. \"When I think of all that Rafael has done, I don't understand it.\"\nLet's be plain: No one, perhaps not even Ferrer himself, expected Nadal to lose Sunday.\nThat's because of Nadal's skill on clay, in general, and at Roland Garros, in particular, but also because of how Ferrer had fared against his friend and countryman \u2014 and video-game competitor \u2014 in the past.\nFerrer entered Sunday 4-19 against Nadal. On clay, Nadal had 16 consecutive victories over Ferrer, whose only head-to-head win on the surface came the first time they played, in July 2004, when Nadal was 18.\nNadal had yet to make his French Open debut then, missing it that year because of a broken left foot. On May 23, 2005, Nadal played his first match at Roland Garros, beating Lars Burgsmuller 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-1 on Court 1, known as the \"bullring\" because of its oval shape.\nAnd so began the reign.\nNadal won a record 31 consecutive matches at the French Open until the fourth round in 2009, when Robin Soderling beat him. In 2010, Nadal started a new streak, which currently stands at 28.\nThere was occasional shakiness this year. Nadal lost the first set of each of his first two matches, and was pushed to a tiebreaker to begin his third. His fourth match, a straight-set win against No. 15 Kei Nishikori, \"was a major step forward,\" Nadal said. Still, he barely edged No. 1-ranked Novak Djokovic in a thrilling semifinal that lasted more than 4 1/2 hours and ended 9-7 in the fifth set Friday.\nBy any measure, that match was far more enjoyable to take in than the final, akin to dining on a filet mignon accompanied by a well-aged bottle of Bordeaux \u2014 each bite and sip rich, textured \u2014 one day, then grabbing a hot dog and can of soda from a street vendor 48 hours later.\nUnder a leaden sky that eventually would release a steady shower from the second set on, Ferrer felt nerves at the outset, he acknowledged later. But after the players traded early breaks, Ferrer held for a 3-2 lead.\nThat's when Nadal took over, winning seven games in a row and 12 of 14 to render the ultimate result pretty clear. It was as if he simply decided, \"Enough is enough.\" His court coverage was impeccable, as usual, showing no signs of any problems from that left knee, which was supported by a band of white tape. His lefty forehand whips were really on-target, accounting for 19 of his 35 winners and repeatedly forcing errors from Ferrer.\nWhen Nadal did have lapses, he admonished himself, once slapping his forehead with his right palm after pushing a lob wide. But what's demoralizing for opponents is the way Nadal slams the door when they have openings, then rushes through when he gets the slightest chance.\nHe was at his relentless best on key points, including those four break chances for Ferrer at 3-1 in the second set. Immediately after, Nadal broke to 5-1 on a forehand winner down the line.\nAs Nadal prepared to serve in the next game, a man wearing a white mask and carrying a fiery flare jumped out of the stands nearby. The intruder quickly was shoved to the ground by one security guard, while another went to protect Nadal.\n\"I felt a little bit scared at the first moment,\" Nadal said, \"because I didn't see what's going on.\"\nIt happened within a few minutes of other actions by protesters, including chanting from the upper deck that briefly delayed play. Police said seven people were held for questioning.\nNadal got broken in that game, then broke back right away to take the second set.\nThe third set was similar to the first. It was 3-all, then suddenly over. Nadal took the last three games, ending the match with a forehand winner before dropping his racket", "baseline_completion": "and falling on his back, leaving a rust-colored smudge on his white shirt and flecks of clay on his stubbled cheeks. Soon he was standing, holding his index finger aloft.\nYes, Nadal is No. 1 at the French Open, without a doubt. When the ATP rankings are issued Monday, however, he will be No. 5, due to points he dropped while hurt. Oddly enough, Ferrer will be at No. 4.\n\"Yeah, it's strange, no? I lost the final against Rafael, but tomorrow I am going to be No. 4 and him No. 5,\" Ferrer said with a grin, then delivered his punchline: \"I prefer to win here and to stay No. 5.\"\nSorry, David. This is Nadal's tournament.\nNow the question becomes: Is eight enough?", "orig_sample_length": 1914, "prompt_length": 1714, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "and raising his arms in triumph.\n\"I think it's an amazing moment. It's amazing to be here again in the final,\" Nadal said. \"I'm very happy about this tournament. I'm very happy about this year.\"\nNadal has won all 17 of his matches on clay this season. He'll next play in Rome on May 11, followed by the Madrid Open the following week.\n\"I don't think I've ever seen a player who plays better on his best surface,\" Ferrer said.\nFerrer, the No. 5-seeded Spaniard who turned 31 on Sunday, reached a Grand Slam final for the first time.

The median sale price in June was $189,000, up 6 percent from $139,000 a year ago, but slightly down from $212,500 in April, the highest level in 1.5 years.\nA declining inventory is also fueling a rise in prices.

Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend. Be positive and encouraging and tell yourself that you can do it.\nWhen you feel yourself starting to tire or slow down, marathon runner and trainer Jeff Galloway suggests practicing the following drill, adapted from his book, \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated.\" Tell yourself that you're going to continue running for just one minute more, reducing your pace slightly for a few seconds, then continue this pattern, telling yourself \"one more minute\" or \"10 more steps\"", "baseline_completion": "until you achieve your goal for the day.

According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved.

Mentally taking a break can help you stay focused. According to Galloway, focusing on another runner or a scenic view can help you relax and stay focused.

Soon, you'll have accomplished your goal of continuing running for the amount of time that you set.\nMaintain a positive outlook while running, and keep reminding yourself that the only person you're running against is yourself. A negative or judgmental attitude may make you feel as though you are not good enough or may be holding you back. When you're running, focus on the road ahead of you or the beautiful scenery. This type of focus may help you to concentrate on what is happening right now.\nDahlkoetter, JoAnn. \"Competitor: Staying Focused in Competition.\" Competitor, 2007.\nGalloway, Jeff. \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated, Stay Healthy, and Stay on Track.\" McGraw-Hill Professional, 2005", "no_wm_output_length": 161, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.8305553197860718, 0.8802152872085571, 0.42141440510749817, 0.42154771089553833, 0.8325436115264893, 0.43402233719825745, 0.35770055651664734, 0.7826336622238159, 0.9372034072875977, 0.36428940296173096, 0.6509195566177368, 0.5680441856384277, 0.583520770072937, 0.38320422172546387, 0.7451677322387695, 0.8935964107513428, 0.7710052728652954, 0.5342909693717957, 0.7357920408248901, 0.6950650811195374, 0.35199785232543945, 0.7259901165962219, 0.6748321056365967, 0.8473189473152161, 0.8881551623344421, 0.3550011217594147, 0.36333194375038147, 0.5754958987236023, 0.3877759575843811, 0.8857163190841675, 0.7247287034988403, 0.8127697706222534, 0.9665919542312622, 0.7839655876159668, 0.5199296474456787, 0.5466192960739136, 0.6675014495849609, 0.6960476040840149, 0.3517792522907257, 0.8113816380500793, 0.5457980632781982, 0.6929004788398743, 0.8583168983459473, 0.908189594745636, 0.8102680444717407, 0.3788508474826813, 0.35276859998703003, 0.5937711000442505, 0.7748683094978333, 0.9548232555389404, 0.7634634971618652, 0.6793303489685059, 0.7441254258155823, 0.36829036474227905, 0.6760715246200562, 0.43938279151916504, 0.4111826717853546, 0.46329665184020996, 0.4501227140426636, 0.9407296776771545, 0.6952038407325745, 0.6124359369277954, 0.8149781227111816, 0.35214242339134216, 0.46949878334999084, 0.7635617852210999, 0.9320896863937378, 0.5502027273178101, 0.7454631328582764, 0.9376308917999268, 0.4215754270553589, 0.46013712882995605, 0.6236222982406616, 0.9351317882537842, 0.9085256457328796, 0.3607853949069977, 0.7410982847213745, 0.8527859449386597, 0.8889466524124146, 0.961608350276947, 0.5315330028533936, 0.35856762528419495, 0.6471317410469055, 0.9647247791290283, 0.519191324710846, 0.9020402431488037, 0.3713566064834595, 0.8774755597114563, 0.6077498197555542, 0.9301019310951233, 0.47751814126968384, 0.8002384305000305, 0.9418798089027405, 0.7464237213134766, 0.660618782043457, 0.354396253824234, 0.6824554204940796, 0.7389912605285645, 0.8484454154968262, 0.5638697147369385, 0.35294705629348755, 0.7799330949783325, 0.9528602361679077, 0.8083986043930054, 0.3524332642555237, 0.8672409057617188, 0.8186298608779907, 0.6613283753395081, 0.6158037185668945, 0.8260156512260437, 0.9193401336669922, 0.3515254259109497, 0.6582032442092896, 0.7139444947242737, 0.6070551872253418, 0.797274649143219, 0.6917506456375122, 0.5253577828407288, 0.738383412361145, 0.8642102479934692, 0.9668810367584229, 0.5028092861175537, 0.367693156003952, 0.3614153265953064, 0.3753444254398346, 0.432656466960907, 0.3895840644836426, 0.3536117374897003, 0.4466574192047119, 0.3846866488456726, 0.8290281891822815, 0.3561408221721649, 0.3832477033138275, 0.823481559753418, 0.8966753482818604, 0.3569188416004181, 0.562497079372406, 0.5328569412231445, 0.35728150606155396, 0.35388901829719543, 0.8106448650360107, 0.8615990281105042, 0.41107654571533203, 0.4762329161167145, 0.695509135723114, 0.3559272885322571, 0.7851967811584473, 0.82469242811203, 0.492023229598999, 0.3671383559703827, 0.5171442031860352, 0.8203427791595459, 0.37812328338623047, 0.529811441898346, 0.8206730484962463, 0.3644849956035614, 0.35166463255882263, 0.3560203015804291, 0.3552316129207611, 0.39068126678466797, 0.36965835094451904, 0.4496579170227051, 0.3544047176837921, 0.3558639883995056, 0.3695484399795532, 0.3534510135650635, 0.35154321789741516, 0.35156551003456116, 0.3982052206993103, 0.3551870882511139, 0.3602917492389679, 0.35733580589294434, 0.3515099585056305, 0.35238879919052124, 0.3517608642578125, 0.3518421947956085, 0.450000524520874, 0.9587664008140564, 0.38183194398880005, 0.7834557294845581, 0.3540325164794922, 0.5047894716262817, 0.523497462272644, 0.7678745985031128, 0.36067238450050354, 0.8023039698600769, 0.6215123534202576, 0.644479513168335, 0.9118483662605286, 0.3584012985229492, 0.47193270921707153, 0.35417410731315613, 0.3522501587867737, 0.6385185718536377, 0.47474780678749084, 0.3606942892074585, 0.3856772780418396, 0.3516520857810974, 0.4587409496307373, 0.8163534998893738]}
{"idx": 151, "truncated_input": "Amazingly, half of all Americans say they don\u2019t care about government surveillance \u2014 and during a random sampling of people on the streets of New York City not one could identify Edward Snowden, or what he did.\nThat\u2019s despite an Academy Award winning documentary on his release of classified documents about the spying activities of a National Security Agency called Citizenfour.\nThe government is collecting data from you all the time. From your phone, computer, tablet, credit cards, travel records and more. We know they are doing this because of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nJohn Oliver traveled to Moscow where Snowden, wanted by the U.S government, has asylum for the next three years. There he interviewed Snowden in an attempt to find out why more Americans don\u2019t care about the government spying on their personal lives.\nBased on Snowden\u2019s explanation of the government\u2019s spying activities, here are five basic questions every American should ask themselves about the NSA surveillance program.\n1. Do you want the government to collect your data (including your naked pictures)?\nAccording to Oliver, Pew Research found that 46 percent of Americans say they don\u2019t care about government surveillance. Why? It\u2019s too complicated and technical to try to trace the life cycle of a text message. Hilariously Oliver tries to put the issue into terms Americans will care about \u2014 whether or not the government has access to your naked pictures. Once everyday folks heard the argument in those terms, they got interested in the debate pretty fast.\n\u201cI did this [released secret NSA spying information] to give the American people the chance to decide for themselves what kind of government they want to have,\u201d Snowden tells Oliver.\nDo you want a government that hoards your most scandalous communications?\n2. Why did the government lie about its spying activity?\nOn June 1, 2015, key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire, including the controversial Section 215 provision, which has been interpreted by a FISA Court to mean that the government has the authority to collect comprehensive data on its citizens.\nPrior to the Snowden revelations about programs like PRISM, American government officials \u2014 including President Obama \u2014 said the government was collecting only basic phone and internet records, like when a call was made and to whom (metadata), rather than the actual content of the conversation. Snowden proved that\u2019s just not true.\nThe Snowden documents showed that the government was collecting and storing the content of Americans\u2019 communications too, like emails, phone calls, internet searches and text and chat messages, rather than just basic call record information.\nWorse yet, it\u2019s not just being looked at; it\u2019s being stored in monster government data centers in Utah, in case it needs to be looked at in the future. So if you want to play a semantics game, they aren\u2019t actively looking at it, just saving a copy in case they need to later. Does that make you feel any better about it?\n3. Can you trust the government with this kind of power?\nMobile phone data provides an incredibly detailed account of your life \u2014 your location, who you call, emails, text messages, internet searches, online shopping habits. Combine that level of detailed data contained in your credit card records, home and work emails and internet searches, and that\u2019s a pretty freaky accurate representation of who you are, where you\u2019ve been, with whom and what you were doing. But not totally accurate.\nYour phone data might put you in a mall food court at the same time as a terrorist, but does that mean you\u2019re a terrorist too? What if you just both happen to love Orange Julius and soft pretzels?\nNow, imagine in the future the government charges you with a crime. Any crime, really. Doesn\u2019t matter which. For belonging to the wrong religion. For being too friendly with someone the government doesn\u2019t like. Happens all the time around the world. Rather than the government having to collect evidence about your crime to prove your guilt, it\u2019ll already have a pile of information on you it can use however it chooses. No warrant. Nada.\nWe might be cool with all of this surveillance capability being used against the terrorists, but what if it\u2019s turned on Americans one day?\nSo do you trust them?\n4. How do we balance privacy and safety?\nThe Patriot Act was conceived amidst the fear following the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. But even one of the primary authors of the Patriot Act, Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, testified that the legislation was never intended to authorize the bulk collection and storage of the communications of U.S. citizens and that its powers should be reined in when the Patriot Act is reauthorized this summer.\nGovernment officials argue that this kind of surveillance is critical for fighting terrorists and those who would do America and Americans harm. That sounds totally reasonable and fair. But with programs like PRISM and other surveillance activity Americans have no idea is going on, how can we have a debate and balance the idea of security against the idea of liberty?\nHow much privacy are we willing to give up for less security risk?\n5. Are you on a watch list?\nAt the end of the interview, Snowden gives John Oliver a pretty ominous warning \u2014 that by interviewing him, Oliver is likely now on a very serious, very scary U.S. government watch list. The idea of a watch list is discussed in more frightening detail in the Academy Award-winning documentary about Snowden, Citizenfour.\nAmericans are put on watch lists all the time, which brings increased scrutiny of communications, increased surveillance and, when traveling out of the", "baseline_completion": "country, often problems getting your passport cleared across international borders without intense questioning. But how do you know if you\u2019ve done something to raise the government\u2019s suspicions about your activity? Am I on a watch list just for writing this article? Are you for reading it? How would we know? It\u2019s a secret.\nThe principles of transparency and checks and balances the U.S. government is founded on demand that citizens be informed about these kinds of government activities. Whether you view Snowden as a hero or a traitor, as he says, now you know what your government is doing in our name. Do you care? Does it bother you?

{"idx": 155, "truncated_input": "New York\u2019s bike share really does attract way more commuters than tourists.\nSince its debut last year, New York City\u2019s bike share system, Citi Bike, has been wildly popular. In its first six months of operation, the bright blue bikes logged more than 5 million trips. The system has nearly 100,000 annual members. Yet Citi Bike\u2013which unlike most bike shares in major cities, isn\u2019t subsidized by public funds\u2013is losing money. One of the main reasons is that while annual memberships are popular, the much more profitable day passes aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a phenomenon easily seen in this visualization of two days of Citi Bike rides around New York City.\nDesigner Jeff Ferzoco, Sarah Kaufman at New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation and Juan Francisco Saldarriaga of Columbia University\u2019s Spatial Information Design Lab worked together to visualize Citi Bike journey data from September 17 and 18 of last year. Over those two days, when the weather was in the 60s and there was no rain, Citi Bike saw 75,000 rides. Rides are separated by type of membership, either annual (blue) or casual (yellow).\nThe visualization doesn\u2019t show exact routes along the city\u2019s grid, but instead approximates trips by tracing straight lines between the endpoints. Ridership picks up early in the morning, around 5:30 a.m., and is heavy between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Almost all of those riders are annual members. Yellow dots are barely visible on the map, except a few around the very lower tip of Manhattan and", "baseline_completion": "up near Central Park. As the day wears on, there\u2019s a slight increase in casual members\u2013people riding over the Brooklyn Bridge, for instance\u2013but for the most part, the vast majority of the map is the blue. During the evening rush hours, when commuters get back on a Citi Bike to go home, the map is overwhelmed by a dense network of blue.\nInterestingly, more riders seem to take Citi Bike during the evening hours than take it to work. The number of active riders hits 800 at 8:30 a.m., but spikes to more than 1,000 at 6 p.m.\nThough the balance of ridership clearly tips in favor of annual membership, it would be interesting to compare this data to a weekend.

The bulk of the ridership is clustered in the central areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the outer boroughs of Queens and the Bronx. Only 17% of all Citi Bike rides during that two-day period were by tourists and visitors; the remainder were made by New Yorkers. That includes 15% of journeys made by annual members and 70% of trips made by casual riders.\nThe chart below shows the same data, but in a different way. Annual members who ride more than once a day are sorted into a single cluster of blue dots. The rest of the annual members are scattered around the map. A similar approach is used for casual riders, except the cluster of yellow dots includes all users, not just the most frequent ones.\nMany of", "w_wm_output": "the Brooklyn Bridge. These are the day pass users, who make up the vast majority of Citi Bike users.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is how the ridership looks like a snapshot of New Yorkers commuting to work.

What exactly did it mean to have something \u201cin the cloud\u201d? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case.

{"idx": 157, "truncated_input": "On Jan. 15, nine of 12 members of the National Park System Advisory Board sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announcing their resignation, effectively dissolving the board.\nIt was an act of protest against an administration with little appetite for the methodical approach the board has brought to national park management for decades. And it leaves the National Park Service without a means to establish new historic or natural landmarks, since federal law requires the advisory board to sign off on such designations. More significantly, perhaps, it\u2019s another crack in the foundation of the Interior Department, which manages 500 million acres of public land and is already rattled by the prospect of some 4,000 job cuts.\nSince 1935, the nonpartisan experts on the National Park System Advisory Board have consulted with the Park Service on its policies and recommended new park units. Lady Bird Johnson served on the board, as did Western writer Wallace Stegner and numerous anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists, architects and social scientists. In recent years, the board has taken a special interest in protecting sites that are of value to Asian-American, African-American, Latino and LGBT communities, and it\u2019s advised the Park Service on management strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nWhen Zinke took office last spring, board members hoped to talk with him about these efforts. But the secretary seemed uninterested\u2014perhaps not surprising, given that a leaked document outlining his department\u2019s priorities scrubbed all mentions of climate change and diversity. In May, Zinke suspended the advisory board, along with some 200 other independent committees that offered management expertise to individual parks or regions. With few options to make their voices heard, advisory board members decided to resign en masse.\nInterior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not respond to a request for comment, but told the conservative Washington Examiner that the department \u201cwelcomes\u201d the resignations of members who she claims ignored sexual harassment issues in the Park Service.\nFormer Alaska governor and advisory board chairman Tony Knowles says sexual harassment didn\u2019t fall under the board\u2019s purview. He also talked with High Country News about why he quit and what the board\u2019s dissolution means for the national park system. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nHCN: Did you get the sense that until this year, the recommendations of the board were heeded, or at least heard?\nTony Knowles: Yes, absolutely. Over the past 7 years, we really made a difference in the direction of the National Park Service. There was a great sense of collaboration. Our board members worked with more than 160 outside experts to come up with recommendations, including to approve 130 new historical landmarks. We went over recommendations carefully with former superintendent Jon Jarvis, and often they became part of Park Service policy.\nHCN: How did that change in the past year?\nTK: At the beginning, we were told that all of the advisory boards were suspended and we\u2019d be notified when it would become part of the agenda to reinstate them. So we waited one, two, three, four months. There was no contract (to allow us to continue our work), no understanding of when a Park Service director would be appointed. In early October, I wrote a letter to Secretary Zinke explaining how the board wanted to meet to inform the new administration of what we envisioned to build a better park system in the 21st century, and to hear what their vision was. We got no answer. I pestered and pestered, and in mid-November got a one-sentence email from someone saying the secretary was very busy. That\u2019s when we realized they were just running out the clock until our terms expired in May.\nHCN: Why did you decide to resign rather than try to influence the direction of the agency from within?\nTK: When you\u2019re on permanent hold, at some time you\u2019ve gotta hang up. There\u2019s no one to talk to but yourselves. By nine of us resigning, we felt we\u2019d be able to get the microphone briefly to at least talk to the American people about climate change, about preserving the natural diversity of wildlife, about making sure underrepresented minorities not only come to the parks but are employees there.

Every single one of us will continue the fight to promote and protect our public lands.\nHCN: Given that your action is part of a larger pattern of resignations and layoffs at the Park Service, are you concerned about the agency\u2019s future?\nTK: Of course we\u2019re concerned. The secretary proposed a 13 percent budget reduction, which would all come out of personnel, then claimed he\u2019s going to rebuild infrastructure by raising park entry fees. If we\u2019re trying to increase the number of people from lower-income groups who want to come to our parks, that\u2019s counter-productive. I also get worried when I think about the unprecedented reduction of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah.

We\u2019re a non-profit organization. It\u2019s not the Federal Advisory Committee Act that oversees us.

It\u2019s a $10-billion (annual) operation. It\u2019s 401 federal parks, and each one is important to the local community. They have to have input from outside experts.

Spoilers tease that everybody will see lots of juicy scenes revolving around the Lulu and Ryan storyline and the January 25 show will seemingly set fans up for a big surprise next week, too.\nAs Friday\u2019s show begins, General Hospital spoilers indicate that Lulu will remain unconscious after the attack and her emergency surgery. The sneak peek shared via Twitter details that Laura will be by her daughter\u2019s bedside, begging her to wake up. In addition, Lulu\u2019s father-in-law, Sonny, will pay a visit to her as well.\nWhile it sounds as if Lulu will face a lengthy, difficult recovery, General Hospital spoilers suggest that she might peek her eyes open during Friday\u2019s show. Even if she does start to regain consciousness, viewers should be prepared to learn that she won\u2019t be able to share any bombshells about her attacker at this point.\nElsewhere in General Hospital, spoilers suggest that Ryan will be finding out whether his sight has been restored. SheKnows Soaps notes that Ava will be by Ryan\u2019s side \u2014 and it sounds as if he probably will be able to see again. Next week, it\u2019s said that he\u2019ll try to finish the job he started with Lulu.\nAcross town, General Hospital spoilers reveal that Jordan will talk with Anna about the case. Jordan had wanted to grill Peter about where he was prior to the attack on Lulu, and naturally, Anna was quite concerned about this. It looks as if Jordan will share some in-depth information with Anna about what they know about the attacks so far \u2014 and Anna will be getting some answers about something.\nDuring Thursday\u2019s episode, Jason and Sam finally made love again. As the Inquisitr previously detailed, Jason and Sam will be fully together going forward, although they will try to keep this development under the radar for the most part. During Friday\u2019s show, however, it seems that Sam will voice some anxiety about what happens when Jason leaves her place.\nJason will promise Sam that things are different now. He was patient in waiting for her to decide what she wanted \u2014 and when she was ready to move forward \u2014 but he\u2019s all-in when it comes to being reunited with his love. While Sam might feel anxious, he\u2019ll promise that he\u2019s coming back.\nFans always love to see Tristan Rogers pop up as Robert, and they\u2019re in", "baseline_completion": "for a treat heading into the February sweeps.

All signs point toward the couple reaching out and doing their best to support the little boy during this journey. The next show will also have some scenes involving Maxie and Peter as a relationship continues to slowly evolve between the two.\nThere are a lot of questions remaining regarding what happens next with Ryan and this case. General Hospital spoilers hint that there may be at least one more victim before he\u2019s caught and he\u2019ll seemingly go to great lengths to avoid detection.

This teaser doesn\u2019t offer much information about what\u2019s going to happen, but it\u2019s clear that the show will be leaving viewers hanging. It sounds like fans will be talking about this cliffhanger over the weekend.\nGeneral Hospital spoilers reveal a lot of drama will take place on the January 25 episode.

{"idx": 164, "truncated_input": "Tue., May 29, 2018, 10:20 a.m.\nCAGUAS, Puerto Rico \u2013 At least 4,645 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria and its devastation across Puerto Rico last year, according to a new Harvard study released Tuesday, an estimate that far exceeds the official government death toll, which stands at 64.\nThe official death estimates have drawn sharp criticism from experts and local residents, and the new study criticized Puerto Rico\u2019s methods for counting the dead \u2013 and its lack of transparency in sharing information \u2013 as detrimental to planning for future natural disasters. The authors called for patients, communities and doctors to develop contingency plans for natural disasters.\nMore than eight months after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the island\u2019s slow recovery has been marked by a persistent lack of water, a faltering power grid and a lack of essential services \u2013 all of which have imperiled the lives of many residents who have been struggling to get back on their feet, especially the infirm and those in remote areas, some of which were the hardest hit in September.\nMiliana Montanez cradled her mother\u2019s head as she lay dying on the floor of her bedroom here in Caguas, gasping for air and pleading for help.\nLeon\u2019s eyes bulged in terror as she described to her daughter the tiny points of light that appeared before her eyes moments before it was all over. She took one last exasperated gulp of air. That\u2019s when paramedics arrived. Far too late.\nLeon\u2019s death reverberated through her family and her community. Her son, a college student in a town two hours away, sees no point in coming home anymore. Her husband is withdrawn and is close to losing his job. Her daughter struggles to understand what happened as she fights off despair and anger recalling all the chaos that revolved around Leon\u2019s last moments on the floor of her home.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s government faced immediate scrutiny after initially reporting that 16 people had died as a result of the storm, which strafed much of the island on Sept. 20. That number more than doubled after President Donald Trump visited in October, when he specifically noted the low death toll. The number kept rising until early December, when authorities said 64 had died.\nThe official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital \u2013 only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.\nThe new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.\nGov. Ricardo Rossells\u2019s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.\nAfter pressure from Congress and statistical analyses from news organizations that put the death toll at higher than 1,000, Rossells enlisted the help of George Washington University experts to review the government\u2019s death certification process. He promised that \u201cregardless of what the death certificate says,\u201d each death would be inspected closely to ensure a correct tally.\n\u201cThis is about more than numbers, these are lives: real people, leaving behind loved ones and families,\u201d Rossells said at a news conference in late February.\nLynn Goldman, dean of GW\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health, expects an initial report to be released in coming weeks. The school\u2019s findings will include the first government-sponsored attempt by researchers and epidemiologists to quantify Hurricane Maria\u2019s deadliness. Experts are assessing statistical mortality data and plan to dive into medical records and to interview family members of those who have passed, though the scope and funding of the deeper investigation is still unclear, as its timing.\nSome cases are obviously storm-related, Goldman said, such as someone dying after a tree branch falls on his head while clearing debris or someone who suffers a heart attack during the storm and was unable to get help. But death certificates bearing the phrase \u201cnatural causes\u201d will require further investigation.\nThe Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico has gone to court in an effort to seek the island\u2019s Department of Health and Demographic Registry\u2019s mortality data for the months since November, the last month information was available. The Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics also announced in recent weeks it would perform an independent death count and use subpoena powers to retrieve the data. Spokesman Eric Perlloni Alayon said in a statement the government is still trying to verify the death toll and does not plan to release any new data.\nThe Harvard researchers reported that there are several reasons the death toll in Puerto Rico has been drastically underestimated. Every disaster-related death, they said, must be confirmed by the government\u2019s Forensic Sciences Institute, which requires that bodies by brought to San Juan or that a medical examiner travel to the local municipality. And it can be difficult to track indirect deaths from a worsening of chronic conditions due to the storm.\nMany families here are awaiting clarity on what happened to their loved ones when \u201cnatural causes\u201d became the only explanation. That is what was written on Leon\u2019s death certificate the morning a local law enforcement official brought the document to the family home. The Puerto Rico Department of Justice\u2019s Yamil Juarbe said in a statement it is customary for local officials in these cases to review bodies for any signs of trauma and talk to relatives to learn about the deceased\u2019s medical history. That information is collected and sent to the central office of the Institute of Forensic Sciences.\nLeon\u2019s family said her name was misspelled on the death certificate and her death was incorrectly attributed to diabetes; they say she did not have any known chronic diseases. Officials later corrected the documents, but it was one of several indignities and oversights the family tracked.\nLeon\u2019s demise began with a virus, and the first signs appeared as she was delivering donations to families of Boy Scouts who had lost their homes in another city, Humacao. During Thanksgiving week, Leon had planned a feast for her family but felt too sick to finish the turkey. She seasoned the bird and a local bakery roasted it. Then the vomiting and diarrhea struck her.\nIt took 20 minutes to obtain cell reception and call 911 from their metropolitan Caguas neighborhood. It took another 10 minutes, records show, before the ambulance could reach Leon\u2019s home because of road congestion and failing traffic lights.

Montanez tried for days to have an autopsy performed, but she said no government agency or private medical organization had the capacity to conduct one.\nMontanez stays awake many nights replaying her mother\u2019s last days. She tries to remember the woman who joked so often, and so wryly, that her children often weren\u2019t sure when she was being serious. She recalls how Leon gave each of her neighbors a whistle to call for help in an emergency during Puerto Rico\u2019s prolonged blackout, and how she organized trick-or-treating by lantern light for the children in the barrio so they wouldn\u2019t miss out on Halloween after the hurricane.\nPublished: May 29, 2018, 10:20 a.m.", "orig_sample_length": 1858, "prompt_length": 1658, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ics placed Leon in an ambulance but the vehicle could not reach the hospital, 15 minutes away.\nLeon\u2019s family rented a car and took her to the University of Puerto Rico Medical Center in San Juan, across the city.

{"idx": 165, "truncated_input": "I didn\u2019t notice, but I\u2019ve been told George W, Bush delivered his latest speech smoothly, more so than most of his speeches. He has certainly practiced the stay-the-course storyline.\nHow many times have we suffered White House fanfare for a presidential speech that will finally solve the mystery of our foreign policy? How many times have we listened, only to reluctantly conclude that George W. Bush is indeed a broken record, and worse for wear?\nGeorge waved the bloody shirt at Fort Bragg, recalling 9-11 and global terrorists. He again brought forth the well-used and amazingly stupid idea that we will somehow take the war to the terrorists. And yes, he was talking about Iraq.\nThose of us living in the reality-based world must be ever so tiresome to our nifty commander in chief.\nIn the real world, Mr. Bush, young Americans die, are maimed and morally devastated by wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, both conducted without legal or moral justification, and hence without hope. In the real world, Americans, Iraqis and Afghans all suffer a conflict dreamed up by finely fed and well-dressed neoconservatives in air-conditioned Washington suites.\nAt leisurely lunches and late night planning sessions they designed a boutique war to be fought by tin soldiers. I imagine the work, and the finger food, was positively delicious.\nAs he has since his 9-11 raison d\u2019tre, Bush emphasized this week that we shall prevail by taking the war to the \"terrorists.\" This must sound great echoing off the peach and lavender rooms of the administration\u2019s unreality-based world.\nOn the other hand, many great thinkers on military affairs have extensively studied the reality-based world, and thus might be helpful. Sun Tzu, for example. The ancient strategist wrote, \"The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\"\nTransfixed by the light of their own brilliance reflecting from pastel-sheened walls and bulletproof windows, the Bush administration hears him not.\nKarl von Clausewitz wrote, \"No one starts a war \u2014 or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so \u2014 without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.\"\nHear, hear! But it seems that the neoconservatives who long envisioned the toppling of the Ba\u2019ath Party, and the emplacement of an administration-friendly Prime Minister in Baghdad as a Do-it-Yourself weekend project, were deafened once again by their own self-congratulatory cheers.\nClausewitz, always trying to help innocent politicians, wryly noted, \"In war the will is directed at an animate object that reacts.\"\nSir Basil Liddell-Hart, in the mid-1900s, not so long ago, expanded upon Clausewitz in this regard. The old Brit noted, \"Natural hazards, however formidable, are inherently less dangerous and less uncertain than fighting hazards. All conditions are more calculable, all obstacles more surmountable than those of human resistance.\"\nAs President, George W. Bush is a public example of a life spent failing to learn from either his betters or his mistakes, refusing to develop empathy when revenge felt better, and avoiding the hard work and self-doubt of personal accountability. He vows to stay the course and exercise his will because without that, he is left alone with his fears of inconsequentiality and too many vengeful ghosts. It\u2019s enough to drive a man to drink, to swear, to cry and crumble.\nThe audience at Bragg was politically controlled and generally pro-Bush, yet the only applause-based interruption of Bush\u2019s speech was apparently the result of a Bush aide\u2019s signaling.\nAmerican service members and their families \u2014 now in the third year of a three-", "baseline_completion": "week war driven by a secret Washington establishment geostrategy and fueled by blatant repetitive lies \u2014 have seen their friends and lovers and children in wheelchairs and in coffins. They have intimately witnessed the disturbing moral fractures and personality changes that are inevitable in war \u2014 whether Congress declares one or not. Unlike George W. Bush, they are challenged by this. Unlike their confident and willful President, they pray every day for their faith to be sustained, and to be delivered from evil.\nThat they might need to be prompted to cheer this particular President is no surprise.\nSir Basil also noted that \"No man can exactly calculate the capacity of human genius and stupidity, nor the incapacity of will.\"\nThe history of George W. Bush and his long-desired and endless war in Iraq may disprove Liddell-Hart on this count.", "orig_sample_length": 1162, "prompt_length": 962, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "year tour of duty \u2014 are bored, discouraged and disillusioned. They are angry at being sent into combat in an unjust war, at being sent into combat without adequate armor, and at being sent to combat without adequate support for their families when they return.\nBush\u2019s rhetoric at Fort Bragg once again massaged a narrow and unrealistic view of the war. He spoke of the \"surge\" as \"successful,\" and of Iraq being \"on the road to peace.\"\nIt\u2019s difficult to look at Iraq\u2019s violence and dysfunction, and see anything resembling peace. It\u2019s equally difficult to look at the anarchy and death in Afghanistan, and not see the end of the war in sight.\nBush, in a revengeful and demented way, has re-written history. He has said we are \"winning", "w_wm_output": "year tour \u2014 who have heard George W. Bush speak a number of times have long noticed his penchant for a smooth presentation.\nHowever, the Bush administration\u2019s greatest sin may be that Bush himself is not the only person who has listened to Bush\u2019s speeches a few dozen times.\nThe most dangerous of the administration\u2019s many mistakes was the appointment of Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense. He was not the first person selected by George W. Bush to serve as his chief military advisor, but he was the first to have an impact on the Bush administration\u2019s ability to conduct a real war.\nGeneral Tommy Franks, Bush\u2019s military advisor at the time of the Iraq invasion, was a good man.

The paramedics performed a cricothyroidotomy (placed a tube through the neck into the airway) to provide air to the patient and then used a bougie (a catheter with a balloon on the tip) to guide the grill down the throat and out the mouth.\u201d The grill was removed and Tedesco was treated for a perforated esophagus.

{"idx": 172, "truncated_input": "Stopping nearsightedness in kids and more.\nThis week, Dr. Sydney Spiesel discusses a way to stop the progression of nearsightedness in kids, a better method of hormone replacement therapy for women after menopause, and new developments in the search for a cause for autism. His column will start appearing a couple of times a month.\nCondition: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the most common eye problem. In the United States and Europe, about 25 percent of the adult population is nearsighted, and in much of Asia the condition is more common still. Significant myopia can have serious medical consequences. It has long been understood that the condition has a strong genetic component: Nearsighted parents are more likely to have nearsighted children. But recent research has shown that other factors contribute. For example, just as our mothers warned us, there is now evidence that doing close-up work, like reading, seems to promote the condition.\nHow it progresses: The eyeball of a nearsighted person is deeper than the eyeball of a person with normal vision and becomes deeper as nearsightedness progresses. Myopia often begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 8. As children grow, their nearsightedness worsens, continuing to do so long after they have stopped growing taller. Though we know a lot about factors associated with nearsightedness and its progression, we have no good ideas yet about the mechanism. But can we stop it?\nNew research: A recent study by Wei-Han Chua and colleagues at the Singapore National Eye Center elegantly built on older research and successfully used atropine eye drops to treat myopia in children. Atropine is a longer-lasting version of the pupil-dilating drops your doctor uses when you go for an eye exam. Available by prescription in the United States, the drops are mainly used to treat amblyopia (lazy eye) instead of the older treatment, patching, which children often hate.\nDr. Chua and his co-workers studied the progression of nearsightedness in 400 children between 6 and 12 years of age. Half the children were treated with atropine eye drops, and the other half were treated with placebo eye drops. Both kinds of drops were administered nightly to one eye, so the untreated eye could be compared with the treated one. The children were followed for two years. All used eyeglasses to correct their nearsightedness, and because atropine dilates the pupil, the lenses of the glasses self-darkened in bright light, to avoid discomfort for the children whose pupils were dilated.\nFindings: The effects were extraordinary: After two years, on average, the children\u2019s nearsightedness had not progressed in the atropine-treated eyes but had dramatically worsened in the placebo-treated and untreated eyes. Similarly, atropine-treated eyes did not become deeper, while placebo-treated and untreated eyes did. No serious adverse effects were observed in the course of the research.\nConclusion: This is extremely promising. Further work needs to be done to determine the ideal concentration of atropine in the eye drops, to find out how long the treatment needs to last, and if the effects are permanent. Because atropine interferes with close focusing, children will probably need to wear bifocals while they\u2019re using the atropine drops. Much more research must be done to help us understand why nearsightedness develops and progresses. But in the meantime, we may have a way to head off this common problem.\nTreatment: Hormone replacement therapy was introduced in 1941, when the FDA approved the use of estrogen for this purpose. Early on, HRT was prescribed with great enthusiasm. It relieved troublesome symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes, sleep problems, and, for some women, difficulty in concentration. And HRT (usually estrogen plus a progestin) was shown to improve the bone density of elderly women and decrease their risk for fractures.\nDownside: Time and further research has shown that these gains come at a cost, however: increased risk for cardiovascular problems, stroke, and blood clots in the veins and lungs. Postmenopausal women on HRT also seem to be an increased risk for breast cancer and possibly dementia. This made many women feel they had to choose between improved quality of life and a risk of ill health and early death.\nNew study: Now research reported in the journal Circulation suggests a way around the blood clotting problem, at least. The researchers studied about 270 women who had developed blood clots in their veins, almost all of them postmenopausal. They were compared with more than 600 women who did not suffer from blood clots but similar in age, smoking status, and age at menopause. Among women in either group who used HRT, the study tracked whether the estrogen medication was taken orally or applied through the skin as a patch or a gel. The nature of the progestin component, if any, was also studied.\nFindings: Estrogen HRT increased the risk for blood clots in the veins\u2014but only if it was administered orally. This result is not as surprising as it might seem. A medication that\u2019s given orally collects in the blood supply of the intestines and passes through the liver before it is distributed to the rest of the body. This causes changes in the proteins synthesized by the liver, some of which are known to increase the clotting of blood. When the estrogen in HRT is administered through the skin, by contrast, it bypasses the liver. The study also established that some progestins (there are many kinds) increase the risk of blood clotting and that others do not.\nConclusion: If these findings are confirmed, HRT skin patches or gels and careful choice of the progestin component could normalize the risk of blood clots in the veins, and also blood clots that migrate to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism, and to the brain, causing stroke. Unfortunately, other studies suggest that administering HRT through the skin won\u2019t affect the rate of heart disease or risk of breast cancer associated with it. HRT will still be a difficult choice. But this study at least lowers the risk and may well shift the balance for many women.\nSearch for a cause: It has long been clear that autism is primarily genetic in origin. The disorder is almost certainly the result not of a single abnormal gene, but rather the interaction of several. In the past, a few locations on human chromosomes have been suspected of playing a role for a scattering of patients. Now researchers have identified a genetic location on a specific chromosome that seems to be associated with the expression of autism in many patients.\nNewresearch: Described in a paper with 137 authors representing 67 worldwide institutions, this finding is the first result of an audacious project conducted by the Autism Genome Project Consortium. The project started with a set of almost 1,500 families with at least two people who fall on the autism spectrum. Of this group, DNA samples from about 1,200 families could be analyzed for chromosomal similarities.\nFindings: This analysis points to a hitherto unsuspected \u201chot spot\u201d on chromosome 11, which seems to be related to an increased risk for the expression of autism. (The genetic function of the hot-spot location is still unclear.) Besides identifying the chromosome 11 hot spot, the data also tantalizingly hint that flaws in the gene coding for a material called neurexin, which plays a role in the development of certain cell-to", "baseline_completion": "-cell transmission sites (synapses), can cause autism in some cases. This trigger for autism is probably quite rare. But it suggests that the disorder is somehow related to abnormalities in the connections between nerve cells that make use of glutamate for information transmission, and defects in those transmissions. How (or even if) these two observations\u2014the hot spot and the neruexin flaws\u2014fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn\u2019t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention. And the neurexin-related discovery hints at the mechanism of what might go wrong in neurodevelopment to lead to autism. These discoveries reinforce the value of collaborative work that puts together information about patients with a relatively rare disorder, from many locales, to create a pool large enough for serious research.", "orig_sample_length": 2014, "prompt_length": 1814, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "-cell connections in the brain, may be important in some cases of autism.\nConclusion: This research provides an excellent initial step in the search for a cause of autism. The next step will be to identify the specific genetic abnormality that is associated with neurexin. This is a monumental task, but it has already begun. The authors of the current study are preparing a large-scale project to analyze the DNA of many more families with autism.\nTags: Atropine, Autism, Blood Clots, Breast Cancer, Children, Eye, Eye Drop, Eye Health, Hormone Replacement Therapy, HRT, Lazy Eye, Menopause, Nearsightedness, Pulmonary Embolism, Research, Stroke, Women's Health", "w_wm_output": "-cell connections in the brain, may be a factor.\nConclusions: These are the first concrete steps towards establishing a clear link between specific genes and the risk of autism.

{"idx": 174, "truncated_input": "In this Sept. 1, 2014 photo released by the U.S. Geological Survey, fluid lava streams from the June 27 lava flow from the Kilauea volcano in Pahoa, Hawaii. The June 27 lava flow is named for the date it began erupting from a new vent. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a warning Thursday, Sept. 4, 2014 to a rural community in the path of a lava flow on Hawaii's Big Island, as the molten rock moved to within a mile of homes. Observatory scientists said lava from the Kilauea volcano could reach the Kaohe Homesteads in five to seven days if it continues advancing through cracks in the earth.\nPAHOA, Hawaii \u2014 Lava from one of the world's most active volcanos has been advancing at a slower pace the past few days and is now moving parallel to a sparsely populated subdivision on Hawaii's Big Island.\nLava from Kilauea volcano was still at least a mile from any homes in Kaohe Homesteads, Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said.\nOliveira took a helicopter flight over the area Monday and saw the lava had crept about 150 yards from the previous day. It's moving north for now but could still stop or change directions.\n\"It's been doing that for the last several days,\" he said of its northern pull. Prior to Friday, it was going northeast toward the subdivision.\nThe Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has warned the lava could reach the subdivision in a matter of days.\nOliveira said he didn't anticipate issuing an evacuation order Monday. But residents should be prepared because it's difficult to predict the lava's movement. It was also raining over the flow site, he noted, which meant there wasn't a wildfire threat.\n\"That's good for today,\" he said. \"But it doesn't get us out of any potential threat down the road. It just means it's going to be a very slow process.\"\nThe lava warning has created an \"edgy\" mood in Puna, the rural region on the southeast side of the Big", "baseline_completion": "Island that is at risk from the lava, said Bill Parecki, a real estate agent who has lived in the area for 42 years.

{"idx": 177, "truncated_input": "After your business is up and running, your focus naturally shifts to increasing efficiency. The small things you do to lower costs and increase output can be the difference between a failing business and soaring profits. No matter how good your team members are, you should tweak the environment in which they work to insure the best possible results.\nThere are many reasons why developing a protocol to measure efficiency benefits your business. You are able to pinpoint areas that need improvement, and you can break your team\u2019s performance down by tasks. Perhaps you will notice that the whole process is going smoothly except for one minor operation that can be eliminated to improve efficiency. This kind of insight can help you restructure the physical environment or delegate tasks in a new way to increase efficiency. You can also evaluate the performance of individual employees. Take a look at how much you get out of employees versus how much you pay them.\nEmployees might be a bit nervous about your new methods of close observation and evaluation. This is acceptable and sometimes even beneficial, as employees will make an increased effort if they know their performance is being tracked. However, you don't have to be an intimidating taskmaster. This is a good opportunity to mix in positive reinforcement and show your appreciation for your team. You can offer incentives, such as public recognition, time off or a share in productivity gains. Whatever mode you choose, employees are sure to improve efficiency if they feel that good work is rewarded and they develop a sense of the needs of the business as a whole.\nEmployees need to have the appropriate equipment and technology to carry out their functions efficiently.

Making sure that your employees have the tools they need to get the job done will drastically improve your output per dollar spent or per unit of time. Keeping equipment up to par also prevents on the job injuries, possible lawsuits and time lost to malfunctions.\nSkill is another side of employee efficiency. Your team must have the requisite skill sets to produce up to par, making on-the-job training and education generally worthwhile. Even though specialization and division of labor are important, your team's efficiency can benefit greatly through cross-training, which gives workers a broader perspective and an understanding of the context in which their work fits. It allows them to help each other and to prioritize more effectively, resulting in overall efficiency.

Your team might accomplish more if the equipment is replaced with the latest technology, such as a new computer, or the technology is upgraded.\nIf you have a large workforce, you will need to organize your team in efficient ways. You might put departments together to help them work together better. For example, you can put the customer service and sales departments together if you think they have complementary skills.

{"idx": 178, "truncated_input": "The University of Maryland President Wallace Loh.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace Loh stood before reporters Aug. 14 and apologized to the family of Jordan McNair, a football player who died days after a team workout. That day, Loh also announced a commission charged with examining the culture inside the school's embattled football program, an undertaking that could prompt sweeping changes at the state's flagship university.\nIn June, the school had contracted with an outside consulting firm to investigate the events surrounding McNair's death. But the commission Loh announced nearly two months later would be charged with a broader inquiry into the culture of the school's football program - a \"thorough investigation by an independent group,\" Loh said - following media reports that suggested some coaches were abusive toward players, relying on fear, intimidation and bullying.\nFew details about the group's work to date are publicly available, but the commission's directives and composition reveal some of the inherent obstacles that arise when independent bodies investigate problems in university athletic departments.\nIn an initial email to the newly-appointed commission members, a copy of which was viewed by The Washington Post, Loh advised that some of the allegations they would be investigating \"probably occur in every football program\" and that the line between aggressive and abusive training techniques is \"imprecise.\"\nAlso, several of the commission members have previous ties with the university and the stakeholders in the affair. One served as a personal advisor to Loh. Another is the brother of an influential booster.\nAlmost immediately after the commission's unveiling, the University System of Maryland's board of regents took control from the College Park campus, adding five additional members to the three named by Loh and suggesting that key decisions about the football program's future would be made by the regents, not necessarily the school president. The vice chair of the board of regents is a prominent donor to the athletics department and has voiced public support for head football coach DJ Durkin.\nThis investigation could go a long way to determining the fate of Durkin, who was placed on administrative leave along with three other member of the athletic staff in the immediate aftermath of the media reports. One of those, football strength and conditioning coach Rick Court, has negotiated a settlement and resigned.\nAccording to multiple people familiar with the process, Durkin was interviewed by investigators on the morning of Aug. 22, and they were particularly keen on questioning Durkin about his alleged use of food to demean players, possible verbal abuse and his handling of injuries.\nThe commission's review is expected to also look at the actions of other prominent coaches and staff members, including Damon Evans, who was promoted to athletics director less than two weeks after McNair's death. Loh, too, could find himself scrutinized by one or both of the external probes. He nixed a plan recommended by the school's athletic director to fundamentally change the way athletes receive medical treatment and athletic training less than a year before McNair died.\nThere is no formal deadline for the commission to complete its review of the football program.\n\"We're trying to get that all done this month, one way or another, so that all the facts we can gather are in front of the board and the campus and then decisions can be made about the future,\" Robert Caret, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said in an interview last week, \"both to protect student-athletes themselves but also to create the kind of environment we want.\"\nA day after he addressed reporters, Loh sent an email to his three new commission members, as well as a handful of school officials, laying out the assignment. He told them \"to interview a sufficiently large sample of current and former players, their parents, athletics staff , and any other relevant stakeholders, in order to make an assessment on whether the relatively few (but deeply troubling) cases of alleged 'abuse,' reported anonymously in the media, indicate the existence of a widespread 'toxic culture' . . . or, do these reported cases represent only a small portion of the population of football players, present and past.\"\nLoh told the members that \"arguably, a hyper-masculine and insular culture is the norm, rather than the exception, in college football.\" Furthermore, he advised them that \"some of the alleged verbally abusive or demeaning behaviors probably occur in every football program. It is part of the 'football culture.' There is, of course, an imprecise line between training practices that aggressively push players to the limit and are acceptable, and practices that most reasonable persons would deem to be physical and/or emotional abusive conduct.'\"\nAsked about Loh's email, Maryland spokesperson Katie Lawson said: \"The president acknowledges that athletic programs are by their nature demanding and intense, and he asked commission members to investigate if Maryland's program crosses a line into destructive or abusive, which is absolutely unacceptable. President Loh has been clear that if such behavior did exist here, it will not be tolerated.\"\nAfter assuming ownership of the investigation two days later, the board of regents added five more members to the commission, including former Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich and Tom McMillen, the former Terps' basketball star who served three terms in Congress.\nIn expanding the panel, the regents faced the delicate task of appointing people who are sufficiently knowledgeable about football and the school but not too partisan.\n\"Ideally, you want somebody who has more than a passing familiarity with that space and the cultures that exist in that space,\" said a veteran college sports administrator, who requested anonymity so he could speak candidly about the process. \"At the same time, that can cause people to be apologists for all that behavior. That's one of the inherent challenges. I know some of the people on the Maryland committee. They're good people, but many are affiliated with the University of Maryland.\nRichard Legon, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said the composition of the Maryland commission on its face appears sound.\n\"I think if you have a former a member of Congress, a former governor, other prestigious leaders who are connected or not to the institution, what you can get to is an outcome with a high degree of credibility,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, credibility allows the board to put greater stock into the recommendations and take whatever actions they're going to take.\"\nThe web of relationships surrounding the Maryland probe is thorny and highlights several areas of possible concern. The eight commission members, who will be compensated for their work, either declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.\nLoh made Alex Williams, a well-respected retired U.S. District judge, one of his three initial appointees to the commission. Williams is the founder, chief executive and namesake of a center focused on justice and ethics housed within the university's school of behavioral and social sciences.\nPrior to joining the commission, Williams had served as a pro bono personal advisor to Loh following the death of Richard Collins III, a 23-year-old student at nearby Bowie State University, who was killed on Maryland's College Park campus in May 2017.\nDon Scheeler, past president of the Terrapin Club, left his name off a letter in support of Durkin that was sent last month to the regents from the Champions Club, a group of high-level sports boosters. His brother, Charles Scheeler, was another of the three commission members appointed by Loh.\nCharles Scheeler is a Baltimore-based attorney at the law firm DLA Piper, who previously served as the \"independent monitor\" charged with tracking Penn State's implementation of recommendations made in the report that followed the Jerry Sandusky scandal.\nHe also was a top deputy for Sen. George Mitchell a decade ago in the exhaustive investigation into performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Scheeler and his associates at DLA Piper have done much of the commission's investigative legwork behind the scenes.\nAsked about the inclusion of Williams and Scheeler, a spokesman said in a statement to The Post: \"Both have the objectivity and talent to contribute greatly to an impartial investigation of the culture of the University of Maryland, College Park football program.\n\"But they are only two of the eight member independent commission, which is comprised of individuals with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, from both in Maryland and outside the state,\" the statement continued. \"The commission's membership is sufficiently large, fair-minded and diverse in perspective to effectively follow the facts wherever they may lead.\"\nIn addition to Ehrlich and McMillen, the other commission members are retired U.S. District Court Judge Ben Legg; Doug Williams, the former Redskins quarterback who serves as the senior vice president of player personnel for the team; Bonnie Bernstein, an alumnus of the school and veteran sports broadcaster; and Frederick Azar, the chief of staff at Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics in Memphis.\nIt's not known how hands-on all eight of the commission members have been. Two of the eight commission members live outside the area, and others have demanding, full-time jobs.\n\"I think the vast majority of them will have had some hands-on experience,\" Caret said in an interview last week. \"I don't know if they've met face to face or not. I know they've all talked.\"\nA spokesman for the regents said that once the commission has completed its examination, it will share its findings with the board of regents, which will then \"make whatever decisions are necessary to better safeguard and support all students and student-athletes.\" The board of regents is made up of 17 unpaid members who oversee Maryland's system of 12 colleges. With the exception of one student representative, each member is appointed by the governor and can serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\nBarry Gossett is a vice chair of the board of regents and also one of the most influential athletic boosters the school has ever known. He donated $10 million in 2007 to build the football program's \"team house,\" which bears his name, and this spring pledged more than $21 million - one of the largest donations the school has ever received - to a center focused on athletes' academic studies.\n\"From a donor standpoint, I kind of stand behind DJ and his program and what he has been doing,\" Gossett told The Post in an interview before the university placed the coach on leave.\nGossett did not respond to requests to comment last week. He had been tending recently to his wife, Mary, who died Monday. The couple have been donors to the school since 1971, championing causes both in and outside of athletics.\n\"Barry Gossett is a highly regarded member of the Maryland community who has served, and continues to serve, the state in countless ways,\" a spokesman for the board of regents said in an email last week. \"At the same time, he is only one of 17 members of the Board of Regents, which will receive the findings of the independent commission.\"\nLike Don Scheeler, Gossett left his name off the Champions Club letter supporting Durkin.\nThe board doesn't typically play a role in personnel decisions at the system's schools, though it does have oversight over Loh, who has led the state's flagship university since 2010.\n\"The board obviously can have influence on the president,\" Caret said.\nStephen Ross, a Penn State sports law professor who directs a cross-campus center on sports issues, said the pre-existing relationships on these investigative bodies aren't usually as important as the underlying motivation behind the appointment.\nHe says there are scenarios where those pre-existing ties could undermine an investigation but others in which they could lend credibility, diversify the commission and appease stakeholders in the event of a critical report.\n\"To me, an ad hoc committee designed to deal with a major public relations problem is itself an exercise in strategic communication,\" he said.\nThere is no rulebook for such investigations and schools can pursue them on their own terms. Similar external exam", "baseline_completion": "inations have been conducted at schools such as Ohio State, Michigan State and Penn State, facing widespread criticism from some corners unhappy with different facets of the respective probes or findings.\nThe Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges issued a formal statement to schools in 2009 saying \"it is time for all [governing] boards to re-examine how they exercise their oversight responsibilities.\" The organization urged governing bodies, such as Maryland's board of regents, to refrain \"from fostering personal relationships with the athletics director or coaches,\" and urging them to \"exercise appropriate oversight while avoiding micromanagement, viewing athletics with a dispassionate perspective.\"\n\"We don't want them running college sports,\"Legon said, \"but we want them to recognize the buck stops with them.\"", "orig_sample_length": 3017, "prompt_length": 2817, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "inations have been undertaken by the University of Michigan, for example, and by Duke University in response to a widespread academic-fraud scandal. Both those groups were tasked with examining the culture of their athletic departments.\nOne of the commission's biggest challenges will be to balance the interests of the athletic department and the interests of the university as a whole.\n\"The problem is the athletic department is a part of the university,\" said the college sports administrator, \"and the university is a part of the athletic department.\"", "w_wm_output": "inations have in the past taken many forms.\nDartmouth College commissioned former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell to investigate the culture under Coach Jim Calhoun, and the University of Texas hired a former federal judge to investigate the football program under Coach Mack Brown, whose handling of a sexual assault case was the subject of a federal lawsuit.\nSometimes, the commission's findings are made public - as was the case at Dartmouth and Texas. Other times, investigators produce a thorough internal report that could remain private - as was the case at the University of Montana.\nMitchell's investigators reported that the Dartmouth football team included a culture of \"harassment, bullying, hazing and alcohol abuse\" and \"a hostile and aggressive tone from the football coach.\" Calhoun denied the allegations, but the university did fire the head of the athletic department.\n", "no_wm_output_length": 119, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.35414397716522217, 0.3515719175338745, 0.759355902671814, 0.6828218698501587, 0.5371619462966919, 0.37335941195487976, 0.7845500111579895, 0.8544743061065674, 0.6497665643692017, 0.654427170753479, 0.7351240515708923, 0.8830544948577881, 0.699515700340271, 0.352091521024704, 0.7615724802017212, 0.8848923444747925, 0.35266926884651184, 0.7293833494186401, 0.894795298576355, 0.35245025157928467, 0.35478365421295166, 0.3536951541900635, 0.7857071161270142, 0.3555655777454376, 0.43797776103019714, 0.3655589818954468, 0.6605021357536316, 0.8141471147537231, 0.8123487830162048, 0.8256785869598389, 0.7356351613998413, 0.7533321976661682, 0.35174795985221863, 0.8365080952644348, 0.558142364025116, 0.3523271679878235, 0.35152101516723633, 0.7874308228492737, 0.581145167350769, 0.8745521306991577, 0.9060648083686829, 0.36772674322128296, 0.9255962371826172, 0.8849427700042725, 0.3519584536552429, 0.7662171125411987, 0.8064512014389038, 0.8586381673812866, 0.5323516726493835, 0.511232316493988, 0.83116614818573, 0.7965632677078247, 0.9088358879089355, 0.5036319494247437, 0.8149827122688293, 0.7456218004226685, 0.3517487049102783, 0.38457533717155457, 0.3537001609802246, 0.4890616536140442, 0.860397219657898, 0.9346400499343872, 0.3542778193950653, 0.8741260170936584, 0.7855518460273743, 0.4412843585014343, 0.6308344602584839, 0.865221381187439, 0.9287757873535156, 0.6738454103469849, 0.35399699211120605, 0.8371483683586121, 0.9379563927650452, 0.7083880305290222, 0.352346271276474, 0.6279359459877014, 0.5897323489189148, 0.9204778075218201, 0.807039201259613, 0.658491313457489, 0.8690876960754395, 0.9340425729751587, 0.8552499413490295, 0.35153713822364807, 0.8996684551239014, 0.3515194058418274, 0.7511356472969055, 0.9126063585281372, 0.40295571088790894, 0.6498875021934509, 0.7897982597351074, 0.7484882473945618, 0.3781663179397583, 0.36525169014930725, 0.6614236831665039, 0.8561829328536987, 0.35186588764190674, 0.35159558057785034, 0.6734621524810791, 0.7321019172668457, 0.5551068782806396, 0.8018122911453247, 0.4099981486797333, 0.452716588973999, 0.7339910864830017, 0.5949850678443909, 0.9351437091827393, 0.6831741333007812, 0.6593682765960693, 0.6241751313209534, 0.5639215707778931, 0.6947221755981445, 0.7501649856567383, 0.8338418006896973, 0.8603321313858032, 0.6884768605232239, 0.6536394357681274, 0.5725997686386108, 0.37821054458618164, 0.3616751432418823, 0.5513622760772705, 0.8707178831100464, 0.40208888053894043, 0.3589355945587158, 0.9306520819664001, 0.35201913118362427, 0.7273695468902588, 0.5136194229125977, 0.9150726795196533, 0.6979050636291504, 0.35491204261779785, 0.706364095211029, 0.35156261920928955, 0.7814643383026123, 0.6081204414367676, 0.8814467191696167, 0.8112785220146179, 0.8530123233795166, 0.9046390056610107, 0.35343024134635925, 0.3516843318939209, 0.7683725357055664, 0.5898803472518921, 0.8068031668663025, 0.8101664781570435, 0.7355915307998657, 0.624882698059082, 0.732943058013916, 0.967979907989502, 0.41460081934928894, 0.3712969124317169, 0.5661547780036926, 0.745642900466919, 0.3519905209541321, 0.5287334322929382, 0.7915049195289612, 0.3516601026058197, 0.5429993271827698, 0.8119276165962219, 0.35151129961013794, 0.4374356269836426, 0.35262227058410645, 0.6853029727935791, 0.7714866399765015, 0.8319859504699707, 0.9509105682373047, 0.9651916027069092, 0.3902495205402374, 0.7750923037528992, 0.8626695871353149, 0.3528348505496979, 0.35732781887054443, 0.8396983742713928, 0.8561041355133057, 0.7855050563812256, 0.7907493114471436, 0.6646736264228821, 0.668632984161377, 0.86296546459198, 0.3519529402256012, 0.3515055477619171, 0.8253012895584106, 0.6830406188964844, 0.6556348204612732, 0.3599047064781189, 0.7371065020561218, 0.7213659882545471, 0.8186439275741577, 0.7941237092018127, 0.9624326229095459, 0.8675581216812134, 0.8560675978660583, 0.8376727104187012, 0.5833525657653809, 0.6431719064712524, 0.7594391107559204, 0.4486640393733978, 0.39289170503616333, 0.7108048796653748, 0.6143259406089783]}

AUCTIONS AND ANTIQUES With the two-week Impressionist -modern-postwar- contemporary smackdown over and done, the auc- tion houses settle back into their new everyday busi- ness-trying to sell expensive works of art in the midst of a bear market. This week, that means works by Latin-American masters. The painter Rufino Tamayo, who ably combined elements of Cubism and Surrealism with Mexican themes and a keen sense of color, is represented by six works in Sothe- by's Latin-American sales (Nov. 18-19). The most important is a monumental canvas from 1955, \"America,\" which for the past fifteen years has been on view at the Dallas Museum of Art. The Tamayos will share the podium with works by the Uruguayan- born modernist Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda and his fol- lowers (known as the School of the South) and by several female Surrealist painters, including Reme- dios Varo and Leonora Carrington. (York Ave. at 72nd St. 212-606-7000.) Christie's Latin-American sale (Nov. 19-20) also features a smattering of Tamayos, the most highly valued of which, \"Sere- nata a la Luna,\" depicts a solitary figure serenading the glowing night sky with a guitar. But the leading lot in this sale-which also includes works by Car- rington, Matta, and the Argentinean artist Emilio Pettoruti-is by Torres-Garc\u00eda, a stained-glass-like composition entitled \"Tres Figuras.\" A few days later, the house shows a more playful side in a pop- culture sale devoted to punk and rock-and-roll items and designer toys (Nov. 24); fans can bid on one of Bob Marley's guitars or on the portable organ played by John Lennon at Shea Stadium in 1965, as well as vintage posters and flyers for the Ramones and the Clash.

{"idx": 184, "truncated_input": "Advocates for government accountability were alarmed to learn Gov. Jared Polis was undecided on whether to veto a bill to expand police transparency in Colorado.\nBut Polis spokeswoman Maria De Cambra set the record straight late Wednesday.\nThe signing is slated for 10:50 a.m. Friday at the Capitol, and it will be open to media, De Cambra said.\nPolis is allowed to wait 10 days to sign bills, which gives him until Saturday in this case. In an earlier call Wednesday, De Cambra had said that the governor was still undecided.\nThe bill \u2014 HB-1119, sponsored by Democratic Denver Rep. James Coleman \u2014 would require Colorado law enforcement agencies to open the files on completed internal investigations into a wide range of police interactions with citizens, including alleged incidents of excessive force.\nThis would mean the public, media, lawyers and any other interested parties would, through open records requests, get a glimpse at how Colorado cops police themselves. As it stands, the Denver Police Department is the only Colorado law enforcement agency that consistently releases comprehensive information following internal investigations.\nThe bill passed the House and Senate and has been sitting on the governor\u2019s desk for about a week, awaiting the final signature needed to make HB-1119 state law", "baseline_completion": ".\nUpon learning Polis was not necessarily on board with the bill, the Colorado Press Association \u2014 one of the primary backers of the bill \u2014 sent out an email to its members that called the situation \u201curgent\u201d and implored journalists and editorial boards to speak out now in support of HB-1119.\nMedia in the state have heralded the bill as a key step toward transparency from an institution that shrouds much of its accountability system in secrecy. The Denver Post\u2019s Noelle Phillips testified in support of HB-1119 this year.\nThe effort\u2019s other supporters include the ACLU and Colorado Common Cause, the libertarian Independence Institute and media groups such as the Colorado Broadcasters Association and the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition.

John Hickenlooper\u2019s office asked lawmakers to withhold the legislation from the governor\u2019s desk. Hickenlooper\u2019s decision was met with anger from advocates who saw it as an attempt to prevent the public from seeing what law enforcement agencies do with internal investigations.\nHickenlooper\u2019s decision was later revealed to have been driven by a desire to keep the law enforcement agencies from having to comply with the law until his term expired. He was considering a run for president at the time.\nBut this time around, Polis\u2019 office has been more forthright about the governor\u2019s decision-making process.\nStill, some advocates remain concerned.\nWhile", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.3693747818470001, 0.562120258808136, 0.9234227538108826, 0.3905511498451233, 0.8631575107574463, 0.9128442406654358, 0.8799710273742676, 0.8211686611175537, 0.8551610708236694, 0.9676082134246826, 0.9188374280929565, 0.5220885276794434, 0.6574486494064331, 0.9104096293449402, 0.7430449724197388, 0.35176825523376465, 0.35160455107688904, 0.6979333162307739, 0.6360552310943604, 0.9016234874725342, 0.9351629018783569, 0.6511269211769104, 0.35153573751449585, 0.6721726655960083, 0.3515280783176422, 0.3933020830154419, 0.5861401557922363, 0.6302775144577026, 0.5943200588226318, 0.43254250288009644, 0.5212396383285522, 0.7614736557006836, 0.86781245470047, 0.5487908720970154, 0.7235710024833679, 0.7662122249603271, 0.35902318358421326, 0.3521067798137665, 0.3572753667831421, 0.569075345993042, 0.5183655619621277, 0.3582552373409271, 0.362358033657074, 0.36578473448753357, 0.831122636795044, 0.3686685562133789, 0.35295942425727844, 0.35633108019828796, 0.35276907682418823, 0.3516128659248352, 0.3515585660934448, 0.35152068734169006, 0.9184632301330566, 0.35167577862739563, 0.6619446873664856, 0.9724959135055542, 0.813163161277771, 0.3709684908390045, 0.35150259733200073, 0.4601735770702362, 0.952121376991272, 0.35248589515686035, 0.8311001062393188, 0.7769181728363037, 0.4032681882381439, 0.8127203583717346, 0.7604885697364807, 0.8197803497314453, 0.7208991646766663, 0.3515658676624298, 0.4522697329521179, 0.35156145691871643, 0.8296908736228943, 0.8784176707267761, 0.3811819851398468, 0.3522621989250183, 0.35168391466140747, 0.9234744310379028, 0.3517824709415436, 0.774884819984436, 0.8888527154922485, 0.9159356355667114, 0.3955680727958679, 0.935889720916748, 0.6696151494979858, 0.9021984338760376, 0.38287365436553955, 0.7602167129516602, 0.9169570207595825, 0.6408731937408447, 0.3603372871875763, 0.7037349939346313, 0.7319280505180359, 0.4417828917503357, 0.9459430575370789, 0.8494077920913696, 0.7709476947784424, 0.3935014605522156, 0.8117935657501221, 0.760144054889679, 0.9107208251953125, 0.4140707850456238, 0.36268535256385803, 0.7465096712112427, 0.35323235392570496, 0.8313966989517212, 0.8432800769805908, 0.8754848837852478, 0.6015405654907227, 0.3568848669528961, 0.6171020269393921, 0.548431932926178, 0.9103314876556396, 0.4271223843097687, 0.35257935523986816, 0.35156986117362976, 0.8774434924125671, 0.3516291677951813, 0.7994014620780945, 0.8653832077980042, 0.9497889280319214, 0.8773611187934875, 0.5636786222457886, 0.5324236154556274, 0.5225756764411926, 0.8888252973556519, 0.5094887614250183, 0.8909284472465515, 0.9394402503967285, 0.46485716104507446, 0.8965721726417542, 0.8361311554908752, 0.8716109991073608, 0.7084507942199707, 0.35223498940467834, 0.684817910194397, 0.39105960726737976, 0.8734433054924011, 0.9437525868415833, 0.5037038326263428, 0.9266329407691956, 0.36651545763015747, 0.42077142000198364, 0.6088285446166992, 0.7924944162368774, 0.8033108711242676, 0.7899607419967651, 0.7751235961914062, 0.7479923963546753, 0.41452154517173767, 0.7578705549240112, 0.7656140327453613, 0.8499611020088196, 0.9500930905342102, 0.655071496963501, 0.5867972373962402, 0.3837836980819702, 0.5927405953407288, 0.7452737092971802, 0.37923067808151245, 0.35484039783477783, 0.6005828380584717, 0.5453914999961853, 0.9221984148025513, 0.9170000553131104, 0.5551618337631226, 0.5583890676498413, 0.3833833634853363, 0.7168052196502686, 0.3515132665634155, 0.6582315564155579, 0.5659234523773193, 0.8819431066513062, 0.8675687313079834, 0.8769774436950684, 0.9066844582557678, 0.5082489252090454, 0.7266013622283936, 0.7386098504066467, 0.7939513325691223, 0.37399718165397644, 0.35162362456321716, 0.8946747183799744, 0.7378484010696411, 0.3527809977531433, 0.5823113918304443, 0.6125327944755554, 0.6712961196899414, 0.8871088027954102, 0.4683273434638977, 0.3612459599971771, 0.8722660541534424, 0.6973196268081665, 0.3621520400047302, 0.8700330257415771, 0.8178226947784424, 0.7102904319763184, 0.6085500121116638, 0.8539953827857971, 0.42674142122268677]}

{"idx": 187, "truncated_input": "Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries, as Christian rulers.\nThis is the stuff of late antiquity as it would be recognised in any classics or history university department. It is, as Tom Holland points out in the opening pages of his latest book, a period of fundamental importance for the shape of our world, as it is the era in which religious monotheism, rather than political kingdom, comes to dominate history.\nIn that context, Holland focuses on the birth of Islam through the prophet Mohammed in Mecca and Medina (modern-day Saudi Arabia) during the course of the seventh century, as it is told to us by one of Mohammed\u2019s biographers, Ibn Hisham, in the ninth century. The faith of Islam, as Holland points out, is centred on the study and strict observation of both the divine revelations to Mohammed (the Koran), and how Mohammed acted during his lifetime (the Hadith and the Sunna).\nYet, echoing what many (mostly non-Muslim) scholars have queried before, Holland points to the historical problem of the evidence: before 800AD, almost 200 years after Mohammed\u2019s death in 632AD, the only \u201ctraces we possess\u201d for the development of Islam \u201care either the barest shreds of shreds, or else the delusory shimmering of mirages\u201d.\nHolland examines late antiquity not as an age of decline and fall, but of energy and inventiveness, setting the Arab world and Mohammed\u2019s life in the context of the changing geographies, cultures and priorities of the empires of Rome around the Mediterranean, the Sassanians to the East, and the religious and cultural melting-pot of the \u201cHoly Land\u201d, which connected them. Holland identifies key events, places, ideas and decisions within the Persian and Roman systems which may have impacted upon the Arab world, and, in turn, on the birthplace of Islam in Mecca and Medina.\nIn so doing, Holland argues for the forging of Islam in the political and military instability and opportunity of a world convulsed by a changing balance of power. The process, he continues, ensured that, by the ninth century, \u201ca version of Islam\u2019s beginnings that gave no scope for anyone to rule as a Deputy of God\u201d, and in turn no room \u201cfor acknowledging the momentous role in the forging of Islam by countless others\u201d, had gained acceptance, the continued presence of which, inevitably, makes Holland\u2019s thesis difficult reading for an Islamic audience.\n", "baseline_completion": "Focusing on the wider context to unpick key moments in history is a classic Holland approach, echoing, for example, his study of the fifth century BC Persian invasion of Greece in Persian Fire (2005), which explored the context and prior history of the Persian and Greek worlds. Such an approach is now in vogue, because it demands that the historian break the often stifling disciplinary boundaries that have traditionally governed the study of worlds which knew no such boundaries.\nThis is a handsome volume, tackling an important question from a novel perspective, backed by useful notes and written in an accessible and fluid style. But, as I am sure Holland would accept, in part because of the charged nature of the material and issues on which it dwells, and in part because of the vast developments and arenas it attempts to encompass, it is also bound to encounter the full spectrum of critical reaction.", "orig_sample_length": 833, "prompt_length": 633, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "The book is beautifully written and informative.

{"idx": 191, "truncated_input": "Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note?\nIn 2014, it was hard to find bad-performing stocks, as the market put in a sixth straight year of gains. For Container Store Group , though, its first full year as a public company was a disaster for investors, with the stock plunging almost 60% last year. Amid falling same-store sales and worrisome trends in overall revenue, confidence in Container Store&apos;s future prospects took a huge hit. Yet as shares have started to stabilize, though, shareholders hope that the worst is over for the company and that customers might return in force to take advantage of the retail chain&apos;s organizational products. Moreover, some enthusiasm both from the professional analyst camp and from an activist hedge fund could help support the stock in the future. Let&apos;s take an early look at what&apos;s been happening with Container Store over the past quarter and what it&apos;s likely to say in its earnings report on Thursday afternoon.\nCan Container Store get its earnings organized better this quarter?Investors are more pessimistic than they were a few months ago about Container Store&apos;s earnings, having slashed their views on November-quarter earnings by 30%. Yet even though the stock has fallen 14% since early October, share prices have bounced off their lowest levels since then.\nJust about all of the damage done to Container Store&apos;s stock came following its fiscal second-quarter report. On its face, 39% growth in adjusted net income seemed like a reasonably promising performance, coming from a 5.2% rise in net revenue. Yet comparable store sales were actually down 0.4% for the quarter, showing just how important Container Store&apos;s continued expansion has been to its overall growth. Overhead costs rose at a faster pace than revenue, and Container Store cut its guidance for full-year revenue by about $20 million and gave lower predictions of earnings per share than shareholders were looking to see. With comps also predicted to fall again this quarter, the stock plunged 25% in a single day following the announcement.\nSince then, Container Store has finally drawn some interest. In late October, a presentation from activist hedge fund Apex Capital highlighted its 4.5% ownership interest in Container Store, with Apex&apos;s founder exploring options such as encouraging faster growth, expense reductions, and even considering selling the company in a going-private transaction. With private-equity company Leonard Green & Partners holding a majority stake in Container Store, Apex will have to convince its institutional peer that its suggested plan of action has merit for the company.\nMoreover, some investors simply believe that Container Store&apos;s stock is cheap enough to be attractive. In November, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded the organizational-goods company, highlighting some of Container Store&apos;s plans to execute a turnaround of its sluggish sales and drive more customers into its stores.\nOne long-term concern that investors need to consider is whether potential cost-cutting moves could endanger Container Store&apos;s renowned corporate culture. The company prides itself on treating its employees well, with generous salaries of roughly double the average in the retail industry. Many argue that treating its employees well leads to better results for Container Store, but without solid earnings growth, reducing compensation costs would be a tempting way for an institutional investor to push more money down to the bottom line quickly.\nIn the Container Store earnings report, be sure to watch whether the", "baseline_completion": "company further reduces guidance. Although the fiscal quarter doesn&apos;t include the whole of holiday season, investors should expect to get a good read on whether Container Store had a successful time in a key season for the retail industry. If Container Store can&apos;t deliver an optimistic message this time around, its stock could easily end up headed downward once again.\nThe article Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note? originally appeared on Fool.com.\nDan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

{"idx": 199, "truncated_input": "AMC Networks Earnings Beat Estimates, CEO Says 'Walking Dead' Franchise \"Will Have a Long Life\"\nAMC Networks on Thursday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings amid higher distribution and advertising revenue as management touted the outlook for hit show The Walking Dead, which is currently in its seventh season and which has been a big topic of debate among Wall Street analysts.\nAMC Networks shares were up 13.6 percent in early Thursday trading at $65.30 as investors cheered the upside earnings surprise.\nIn the company's earnings report, he had similarly said: \"The Walking Dead remains the No. 1 show on television by a wide margin and is a powerful example of programming that we own and distribute that commands a loyal audience, attracts advertising revenue, and has significant ancillary revenues that will benefit our business for years to come. With a rapidly expanding studio business, we now have a growing portfolio of shows that we own that provide this kind of opportunity for our business.\"\nAsked about the studio business on the call, Sapan said: \"The company is becoming and has become more of a studio,\u201d rather than \u201conly a channel operator.\u201d He said that has allowed its shows to play on its own channels in the U.S. and internationally, then go to Hulu or Netflix in a later window in the U.S. and be sold to other distributors in foreign markets where the company has no channels.\nAMC Networks so far has not produced shows only for other companies and has no plans to do so, but could consider such a production approach longer-term if the financial returns and strategic benefits make sense, said Sapan.\nAsked about the company's channel portfolio, Sapan said its quality and pricing counts more than the number of channels at a time when some peers may have to close down weaker channels, according to analysts. \"We have been of the mind for some time that quality matters, brands matter, content matters, engagement matters,\" said Sapan. \"And you don\u2019t get a free lunch for showing up with 22 channels.\" He added that his team felt that \"a day of reckoning would come\u201d for some peers.\nWhile the company felt SundanceTV and BBC America, in which it bought a stake, are well-defined channels, overall, he said, \"we have already skinnied our offering down.\u201d And AMC Networks channels should still get higher carriage fees, he reiterated. \u201cCollectively, they are underpriced,\" said Sapan.\nThe cable networks company on Thursday posted a profit of $14 million for the latest quarter, or earnings per share of 20 cents, compared with $90 million in the year-ago period, or $1.23. The company in the latest quarter took non-cash impairment charges of $68 million related to AMC Networks International-DMC, its Amsterdam-based media logistics facility.\nAdjusted for charges, earnings reached $92 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with $102 million, or $1.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in adjusted earnings per share was \"primarily related to the increase in adjusted operating income more than offset by an increase in miscellaneous expense.\" Wall Street analysts had on average expected earnings of $1.27 per share. Estimates had come down a bit after Sapan in December said that advertising was looking softer than anticipated.\nA 9.2 percent increase in quarterly operating income and 9.2 percent adjusted operating income at the company's U.S. networks, which include AMC, IFC and SundanceTV, reflected higher revenue, offset by an increase in operating expenses. \"The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses,\" the company said. \"Programming expenses included charges of $5 million in the current-year period related to the write-off of programming assets, as compared to charges of $16 million in the prior year period.\" The company didn't immediately say which show or shows the write-off was for.\nU.S. advertising revenue rose 3.1 percent despite lower ratings in the quarter for the first half of season seven of The Walking Dead. U.S. distribution revenue jumped 15.6 percent.\n\"2016 was a successful year for our company both financially and operationally, driven by our disciplined and focused strategy of investing in high-quality content and creating brands that have strong, growing, passionate and engaged audiences,\" said Sapan.\nHe continued: \"We are embracing changing viewing habits by making strategic investments in streaming services that fit well with our programming and the audiences at our network brands. As we look ahead in 2017, we see a number of attractive growth opportunities for our businesses and remain committed to delivering meaningful value to our shareholders.\nMichael Morris, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners, said in a note previewing the results: \"Season 7 of The Walking Dead premiered in late October, and though the show started strong, by the mid-season finale ratings were declining in excess of 20 percent on a year-over-year basis, worse than the 15 percent decline built into our estimates.\"\nHe lowered his fourth-quarter U.S. networks advertising growth estimate for the fourth quarter to 0.5 percent from 6.0 percent \"given The Walking Dead's recent ratings trends.\" Sa", "baseline_completion": "id Morris: \"This is consistent with management commentary provided in December. We expect the show to remain in production \u2014 and popular with consumers \u2014 for the next several years, and as such we anticipate related ancillary revenue (from digital and international partners) to remain intact.\"\nBut, he warned, \"Investor concern around the company's key Walking Dead franchise continues to weigh on shares. We continue to believe that market value under-appreciates the company\u2019s ability to develop and monetize compelling programming. However, we do not see a clear path to investor realization and thus remain cautious in our target valuation multiple.\"\nSapan on Thursday also touted the ratings performance of the company's networks.

{"idx": 200, "truncated_input": "Jan. 22 will be here before agencies know it. So will Feb. 6. Here\u2019s betting that even April 16 will be here seemingly tomorrow.\nThose are the 45-day, 60-day and 120-day deadlines folded into the Open Government Directive, issued by the White House last month. The first, which arrives soon, is when every federal agency must identify and publish online at least three high-value datasets it plans to make available to the public.\nFifteen days after that, each agency must launch an open-government Web page that is ready to be updated in a timely fashion. By April 16, each agency must unveil an open-government plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities.\nThose are tall orders in short times, to be sure. However, most agencies haven't devised an open-government plan, decided what data is high value or figured out how to share it with the public. The directive is a sweeping mandate designed to transform the way the federal government interacts with the public, yet even its White House authors say each agency is essentially moving through this territory on its own without a road map.\nAgencies have few choices for figuring out how to comply with the directive. They can go it alone and create a plan that they hope makes the grade. Perhaps some will join forces or find industry partners that might guide them to a successful outcome. Or, counting on the kindness of strangers in the White House, they can rely on promised support from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where the authors of the directive live.\nBut even though the vagueness of the directive is a challenge, most agencies agree that it could be worse. Flexibility is better than getting strict and possibly draconian requirements that don\u2019t account for agencies' special needs and different missions. For example, the way NASA shares images of the surface of Mars needs to be different than the way the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shares airline flight delay data.\nThe two men behind the directive are federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. By the Feb. 6 deadline, they are supposed to establish a dashboard on WhiteHouse.gov that will aggregate statistics and visualizations so the public can see how various agencies are doing.\nThe goal of the dashboard is not to highlight agencies\u2019 failures, Chopra said.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to", "baseline_completion": "assume that new efforts in public engagement will be an evolution of older programs. For example, the General Services Administration published 12 years' worth of Federal Advisory Committee data onto Data.gov the day after the directive was announced.\nDavid McClure, associate administrator of GSA\u2019s Office of Citizen Services and Communications, suggests that agencies take a close look at whom they serve and then provide data that will be the most valuable to people.\nBut with the directive\u2019s deadlines fast approaching, it\u2019s not clear if all, much less many, agencies will be able to demonstrate the early goals of openness and transparency. After all, the memo issued by President Barack Obama that got all this whole thing rolling called for the directive to be published by late May 2009. It ended up being released Dec. 8, which shows that creating a transparent government isn\u2019t a see-through process.", "orig_sample_length": 776, "prompt_length": 576, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "expect some agency failures. As one senior executive put it, \u201cAgencies have to be given the flexibility to take risks. Most will fall flat on their faces.\u201d Acknowledging that, Kundra said in a recent interview that agencies won\u2019t get credit for failing if they try to do the right thing, but they will get dinged if they do nothing.\nAnd, while agencies are given the flexibility to innovate, they are not given a free pass to ignore the directive.\nThose are the two big challenges agencies face as they try to comply with the directive. But there are others, too.\nCost is a big issue.\nAgencies need to develop a plan, as well as find and develop the technology that will help them make their data available to the public, said Bill Eggers, Deloitte\u2019s director of public sector research. All of that will cost money,", "w_wm_output": "assume, however, that the open-government effort could generate an unprecedented amount of scrutiny in Washington. The OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs was criticized as being too secretive when the DATA Act was considered in Congress earlier this year. So, the idea of the open-government team being under intense scrutiny is not a stretch.\nMembers of the federal IT community have also expressed concern. The directive requires an uncomfortable degree of collaboration with the private sector, which is not a natural fit for government officials.\nHowever, many agencies have already formed working groups to develop their plans. They have also been collaborating with the private sector via industry groups such as the Open Government Working Group.

{"idx": 207, "truncated_input": "Perhaps more than any other age group, 8- to 12-year-olds are investigators of sorts, discovering their strengths and weaknesses and how they fit into the world. Sylvie Weil reinforces this idea in My Guardian Angel (Arthur A. Levine), which tells the story of Elvina, an 11th century Jewish girl who secretly cares for a wounded Christian Crusader despite fears of what his compatriots might be planning for her community. The Shadows of Ghadames (Delacorte), by Jo\u00eblle Stolz, is set 800 years later in Libya, yet 12-year-old Malika finds herself in a similar situation. She longs to travel and study like her father and brother do, but as a Muslim female, she isn\u2019t allowed. When an injured man in trouble is taken into her home, however, her world broadens a bit more.\nA retelling of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 Tales of Don Quixote (Tundra) packs the title character\u2019s deeds into 200-odd pages, just one-fifth of the original work. Barbara Nichol\u2019s treatment, however, captures the spirit of the aging knight-errant determined to right all the wrongs\u2014some imagined, some not\u2014that he comes across. The adventures of the orphaned Stephen Lansbury are, on the whole, less imaginary but just as bizarre. In The Valley of Secrets (Simon & Schuster), by Charmian Hussey, young Stephen unexpectedly inherits a strange estate after an unknown great-uncle dies, and he must use the uncle\u2019s diary about a trip through the Amazon to unravel the supernatural goings-on.\nThe 11-year-old in Joan Givner\u2019s Ellen Fremedon (Groundwood) sometimes wishes she were an orphan because her bratty twin siblings always seem to be getting in the way. Ellen\u2019s biggest worry, though, is that she won\u2019t be able to put enough interesting tidbits into the novel she\u2019s writing\u2014until the twins go missing after looking into an environmental threat to their community. In Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen (Knopf), it\u2019s the cats who are disappearing. Wendelin Van Draanen\u2019s ninth Sammy Keyes mystery has the skateboard-riding girl detective contending with an increasingly vicious school enemy while figuring out why large numbers of neighborhood felines are unaccounted for.\nIt\u2019s no mystery where Indigo Casson has gone: He was taken out of school for a semester to recover from mono.", "baseline_completion": "Indigo\u2019s Star (Margaret K. McElderry), Hilary McKay\u2019s sequel about the Casson family, opens with the middle schooler dreading his return to a place where he\u2019d been relentlessly bullied. Yet aided by a new student and his precocious youngest sister, Rose (the Casson kids are all named after paint colors), Indigo learns to stand up for himself. The title character of Becoming Naomi Le\u00f3n (Scholastic), by Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan, must do the same after her alcoholic mother shows up (following a seven-year absence) and disrupts Naomi\u2019s happy life with her younger brother and great-grandmother. When Naomi discovers the courage hinted at by her name, she not only reclaims her family but also expands it, establishing a relationship with her father, who had been kept from her.", "orig_sample_length": 803, "prompt_length": 603, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "In The Westing Game (Scholastic), by Ellen Raskin, 13-year-old orphan Dell Mitchell hates the dreary events held to celebrate the death of an eccentric recluse, who left the celebrants a puzzle in his will. Dell enjoys the challenge and, when she wins, finds herself the unexpected recipient of the dead man\u2019s vast fortune. It\u2019s a mystery that will keep you guessing until the end.\nAnother mystery is why the werewolves in The Witches of Blackbrook (Knopf) are migrating to the small town of Blackbrook. The new teenage resident, Felicity Pickle, is curious about the disappearing animals, but she\u2019s more concerned with her abusive stepfather\u2019s drinking and her dead mother\u2019s involvement with the occult.", "w_wm_output": "He\u2019s bored out of his mind at home, so he begins to read his brother\u2019s books on witchcraft and alchemy and starts tinkering with potions and elixirs. He passes his time away, but when he returns to school, he\u2019s changed, and not in a good way. In Changes, by Nancy Garden, Indigo finds himself increasingly at odds with his new, meaner, angrier personality.\nA different sort of teenaged heroine takes over in Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (Little, Brown). Georgia Nicolson is a fun-loving girl with a few foibles, some quirky friends, and a crush on a boy she\u2019s never met.

{"idx": 211, "truncated_input": "Question: What's one company culture characteristic that you have found makes your startup employees the happiest? How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. The predictability and structure of these meetings make it extremely easy for employees to deliver feedback, both good and bad. This level of transparency and communication keeps employees happy and motivated.\"\n\"At RTC, we have a motto as a publisher: \"Don't expect your reader to change through reading your book if you haven't changed through writing it.\" That motto defines our core belief that continual growth is necessary for the human spirit to regularly experience joy in the workplace. As a result, our executive team strives to help our staff remove aspects of their work that do not bring them joy so that they can focus on what they love doing. By intentionally making room for them to focus on what they enjoy, they are able to grow out aspects of the business that bring them deep personal satisfaction while also serving our clients. We've developed entire new lines of business this way, as well as new positions within the company. Support their dreams, and they will grow your business.\"\nFollow Rule #2: Have Fun!\n\"When my co-founder and I started 'ZinePak, our business plan read simply, \"Make money. Have fun.\" As the company has grown, we've made sure not to lose sight of this mission. At the end of each day, we ask our employees if they had fun that day. Almost without fail, the answer is always \"yes.\" We try to always remember that we're an entertainment company. We aren't changing the world. We aren't curing cancer. No one's life is at risk, so there is no need for the doom-and-gloom culture that seems so prevalent in Corporate America. From half-day Fridays to candy jars to days off for charitable activities of the employee's choice, we try to mix \"fun\" into everything possible to ensure that work feels as much like play as possible.\"\n\"We always take time to celebrate our wins. Whether it's a new project, new teammate or new launch, we take time to recognize team and individual successes. Taking small breaks to socialize and catch up at team happy hours reenergizes the team and ultimately leads to awesome workflow and collaboration. Our internal party planning committee makes consistent plans to pull us away from our desks and into fun environments where we can take our minds off work for a bit.\"\n\"I think that people are generally happiest at work when they are engaged by the work that they do. Doing the same jobs, having the same responsibilities and facing the same tasks day in and day out can get tiresome. In my company, there is a variety of work to be done, and employees are encouraged to embrace the variety. This keeps work fresh. We also support telecommuting (to the degree that we don't even have a \"home\" office -- all work is done \"off-site\") and flexible schedules. We trust our team to do their work when they can and where they can. Work variety and flexible work results in employees who are happy and productive. \"\n\"When we started, we had been told to be careful of what we share with our employees and other stakeholders. We, however, are very open and transparent communicators and did not keep anything confidential and didn't hold back any information. This allowed our early employees to not only feel like they were playing an important trusted role in making an impact on growing the company, but also allowed them to dissent and suggest better ways of accomplishing objectives. They respected the founders because they saw not just what decisions we made, but how we made them, right or wrong. And for failed experiments, we had their support and morale to pivot quickly. Each and everyone felt individual ownership for each decision and worked that much harder to succeed, because they never felt separate.\"\n\"Every other Friday, someone different leads our team workout. We've played tennis and basketball, done yoga and CrossFit and even learned (barely) various martial arts. Unintentionally, we've taken risks doing new things, discussed how we're improving our lives (not just our work) and laughed a lot. The benefits of exercise combined with the additional vulnerability, camaraderie and fun has increased the happiness quotient of Team Fig. \"\n\"When people hear the words \"company culture,\" they often think about ping pong tables or beer taps. While those sorts of perks are cool, they really don't matter unless you've created the right work environment to embrace them. You create that environment by giving people a voice. When we built our new corporate office space, it was very important to solicit opinions and ideas", "baseline_completion": "from our employees. Before moving into our new facility in 2011, we hosted an internal version of Pinterest where employees could put ideas and pictures that they felt should be considered for the new space and workstation setups. In the end, when you're making a decision based on democratic feedback, you need transparency. People will be invested in the outcome as long as they feel like the process is fair. \"\n\"The characteristic that I swear by is living the mission every day. Oftentimes, people join your team/company as a startup because you are doing something different or you're doing something the way no one has done it before. You cannot afford to lose that, and you have to live that everyday. For us, that is our mission. Everyone who has joined our team is in it for the mission, and we push it and live it every day, which makes our team members happy. \"", "orig_sample_length": 1267, "prompt_length": 1067, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "from everyone.

'Kid's camp' gets the whole team fired up, and the fun continues on Friday afternoons, which is 'game day.' Our team goes all out with games like kickball, sack racing and a 'duck, duck, goose' tournament.

{"idx": 212, "truncated_input": "On Tuesday, August 20, a US army veteran named Mark Paslawsky was killed during a battle in Ilovyask, near Donetsk, which is currently held by anti-Kiev rebels.\nFighting on the side of pro-government forces, the American had sprung to prominence because of his Twitter feed (@BruceSpringnote), often sharply critical of Ukrainian politicians, and a fawning video interview with Vice News\u2019 Simon Ostrovsky shortly before his death.\nThe 55-year-old West Point graduate, who was also a former investment banker, mainly focused on Moscow, Kharkov and Kiev, claimed he had changed his nationality to Ukrainian to enlist in the Donbass Battalion. Paslawsky fought under the pseudonym \u2018Franko\u2019 and served in the US army until at least 1991, when he was described as a captain in a New York Times op-ed.\nThere was a very good reason for Paslawsky\u2019s use of a nom-de-guerre like \u2018Franko\u2019 and the social media handle \u2018Bruce Springnote\u2019 and for the soft soap in the US media.\nPaslawsky was not an \u201cordinary Joe\u201d from New Jersey with benign family connections to Ukraine who suddenly decided to help defend the motherland, he was the nephew of the notorious Nazi Mykola Lebed \u2013 who incredibly was employed by the CIA from 1949 to possibly as late as 1991. There is no insinuation that Paslawksy also harbored fascist or anti-Semitic beliefs, but family influences surely played a significant role in the formation of his world view.\nLebed began his terrorist career in 1934 when he was sentenced to death for the murder of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki \u2013 later commuted to life imprisonment \u2013 but he escaped in 1939. He would go on to lead the genocidal ethnic cleansing of Poles in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia (the area around Lutsk and Rivne in modern-day Ukraine).\nInstead of facing trial for his vicious war crimes after his fellow fascists in Germany were defeated, Lebed was spirited to America where \u2013 based in New York \u2013 he gathered information on the Soviet Union for the CIA (a scheme known as Operation Aerodynamic).\nOf course, sheltering Nazis was a common US practice after the war, as bizarre as it seems today, with the primary reason being their potential usefulness in the fight against the Soviet Union. The best known example is Klaus Barbie who they helped to escape to Bolivia, and later Argentina, but according to a 2009 National Archives report \u201cHitler\u2019s Shadow: Nazi War Criminals, US Intelligence and the Cold War\u201d there were dozens of similar cases. Among them was Rudolf Mildner, who was \u201cresponsible for the execution of hundreds, if not thousands, of suspected Polish resisters\u201d and was also involved in the deportation of 8,000 Danish Jews to Auschwitz. The Americans helped Mildner to settle in Argentina. Another was Hans Scholl, a member of Einsatzgruppe B in Belarus, which was blamed for the execution of more than 45,000 people, most of them Jewish.\nThe report goes into great detail about the hideous crimes of Paslawsky\u2019s uncle. One man extensively quoted is Moshe Maltz, a Jew living in Sokal, a town about 85 kilometers north of Lviv: \u201cWhen the Bandera gangs (a name inspired by the chief Ukrainian Nazi leader, Stepan Bandera) seize a Jew, they consider it a prize catch. The ordinary Ukrainians feel the same way\u2026 they all want to participate in the heroic (sic) act of killing a Jew. They literally slash Jews to pieces with their machetes.\u201d Lebed trained at a Gestapo center in Zakopane.\nInterestingly, in 1985 the US Government Accountability Office in Washington mentioned Lebed\u2019s name in a public report on Nazis and collaborators who settled in the States with help from US intelligence agencies. The Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in the Department of Justice began investigating Lebed that year.\nThe CIA shielded Lebed and, as late as 1991, it dissuaded the OSI from approaching the German, Polish, and Soviet governments for war-related records about Ukrainian fascists. Lebed, Bandera\u2019s wartime chief in Ukraine, died in 1998. He is buried in New Jersey.\nLeded married Sophia Hunczak, the sister of Taras Hunczak, a professor emeritus of Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he lectures in Ukrainian, Russian and European History. He also teaches at the Taras Shevchecnko University in Kiev. Despite being a child during World War II, his Ukrainian language Wikipedia entry, judging by the links and tone, an official bio, lists his service as a courier for Bandera\u2019s forces during the war.\nHunczak has written articles for Ukrainian journals whitewashing Roman Shukhevych and his Nachtigall Battalion, including some heavy duty eulogies obviously intended for internal consumption in the Ukrainian language. The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles claims that between June 30 and July 3, 1941, the Nachtgall and their German comrades kidnapped and killed 4,000 Jews in Lviv. In 2007, the pro-NATO Ukrainian government of Viktor Yushchenko issued a postage stamp commemorating Shukhevych.\nSo how we do know Paslawsky is the nephew of Lebed after his extensive efforts to hide his true identity? His Ukrainian-language Wikipedia entry refers to him as being the nephew of Hunczak and also mentions a brother, Nestor.\nIn the September 13, 2009, edition of the US newspaper The Ukrainian Weekly, there is a death notice forSophia Lebed(this page has been removed from the PDF copy on their website as of August 28, but copies are in circulation, one pictured above) lists all her living relatives, including her brother, Taras Hunczak, and her nephews Nestor and Markian (Mark in English) Paslaw", "baseline_completion": "sky. While it mentions Nestor\u2019s family, it doesn\u2019t for Mark \u2013 he told Ostrovsky in the Vice interview that he was a single man.\nA second death notice for Sophia, at the Union Funeral Home in New Jersey, describes her as the \u201cbeloved wife of the late Michael (the English form of Mykola) Lebed.\u201d Interestingly, this page was removed on August 27 after Ukrainian violinist Valentina Lisitsa questioned the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty about it on Twitter \u2013 it now exists as a cached version only.\nSomebody has been trying to hide the true story of Mark Paslawskyin recent days and western media have shown no interest in telling it.\nThe German language has a word for coming to terms with the past: Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung.

{"idx": 215, "truncated_input": "A British father and his two young children died when their car crashed on a French motorway amid fears he may have fallen asleep at the wheel.\nThe mother and their youngest child were in hospital on Sunday night having survived the horror smash, which happened during a family holiday.\nThe dead man was named locally as John Crompton, 31, from Hartlepool and it is understood his son Morgan, believed to be nine, and daughter Evielily, four, also died at the scene.\nMr Crompton\u2019s partner Makayla and the couple\u2019s third child, thought to be aged two, were critically injured and airlifted to a nearby hospital.\nFrench investigators said it was possible the driver may have fallen asleep behind the wheel or was distracted by something which caused him to veer off the road.\nRelatives in the close knit community in north Hartlepool were too devastated to talk yesterday but neighbours spoke of their shock at the tragedy.\nThe accident happened around 7:15 am local time on Sunday morning as the family\u2019s Nissan car was travelling south on the A39 motorway between Dijon and Bourg-en-Bresse in the east of France.\nThe car is believed to have gone over a railing, smashed against a wall and then landed in a crumpled heap back on the road.\nThe three children were thrown from the car as it turned over after smashing into the wall.\nThe roof of the car was torn off by the impact and the vehicle was left on its side in the middle of the road, with the family's belongings strewn across the motorway.\nPolice said it was not clear what caused the vehicle to veer off the road and smash into the concrete wall of a motorway bridge but no other vehicle was involved in the collision.\n\u201cThe crash may have been due to the driver falling asleep at the wheel or perhaps the driver was distracted by something and veered to the right,\u201d said senior regional official Georges Bos at the crash site.\nGendarme Captain Gilles Quintaine told the Telegraph that an inquiry had been launched to determine the cause of the accident.\n\"We don't know how long the father had been driving for, whether he had been at the wheel all night or whether he had just got on the road this morning,\" he said.\n\"We are hoping that family members will be able to help us with that. We don't know what the family was doing in France but it looks like they were on holiday because their car was packed with luggage,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the France3 TV channel, a member of the emergency services said two of the children were dead when they arrived and the father was trapped.\nTwo air amublances were called to ferry the injured mother and surviving son to hospital and police closed off the motorway for several hours.\nThe scene was so devastating that a psychologist was brought in to counsel the two dozen rescue workers who worked at the crash site.\nIn Hartlepool", "baseline_completion": ", one neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: \"John was a big lad, he was only young. He's very much like his mum.\n\"It's absolutely awful. I'm just in shock.\"\nAnother neighbour said: \"I knew that they were going away on holiday. It's just such a shock to be honest.\"\nAnother added: \"All I heard was that they have lost a son and a daughter. I know John worked in Italy so he might have been on his way there.\n\"I'm just shocked. I still can't believe that it has happened to somebody we actually know.\"\nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We are providing assistance following a road traffic accident in France, in which three British nationals have sadly died and two others have been hospitalised.\n\"We are working closely with local authorities and supporting the families at this difficult time.\"", "orig_sample_length": 878, "prompt_length": 678, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ", the three children\u2019s school friends were too upset to speak about the tragedy but other residents said the family were well-known in the area.\n\"This is shocking.

They had a few teenage daughters and a young boy.\n\"There were a lot of kids round here who knew them.\n\"They were a really nice family and the kids were well-behaved.\n\"They are a really nice family.

{"idx": 217, "truncated_input": "Technological change has always posed a challenge for companies. But, as we saw once again in 2015, it has never occurred as rapidly, or on as large a scale, as today. As innovation sweeps across virtually every sector, from heavy industry to services, it is transforming the competitive landscape, with the most advanced companies\u2014rather than the largest or most established players\u2014coming out on top.\nFor incumbents, the threat of displacement is very real. The average tenure of a company on the S&P 500 has fallen from 90 years in 1935 to less than 18 years today. Disruptive new players like Uber, which has upended the taxi industry, are tough competitors, often staking out market share by shifting more surplus to consumers. This is part of a broader trend of intensifying competition that, according to recent research from the McKinsey Global Institute, could reduce the global after-tax profit pool from almost 10% of global GDP today to its 1980 level of about 7.9% within a decade.\nThe effect of technology on competition arises largely from the power of digital platforms and network effects. New digital platforms reduce marginal costs (the cost of producing additional units of a good or service) to nearly zero. Adding, say, a Google Maps user carries negligible costs, because the service relies on GPS location data that is already stored on a user\u2019s phone. This allows Google to scale incredibly quickly, and then to leverage this scale (and the convenience of having a single platform) to move into adjacent sectors\u2014such as music (Google Play), payment (Google Wallet), and word processing (Google Docs). In this manner, tech firms can quickly come to challenge incumbents in seemingly unrelated industries.\nOf course, tech firms are not the only ones innovating. A handful of leading firms in practically every industry are deploying digital technology in increasingly sophisticated ways\u2014and seeing huge benefits. The use of sensors to monitor livestock, for example, has far-reaching implications for the food industry.\nBut the most digitally advanced sectors show the greatest progress. Indeed, over the past 20 years, profit margins in these tech-infused sectors have grown two-three times faster, on average, than in the rest of the economy. Even within the most advanced sectors, there is a yawning gap between the top-performing companies and the rest of the pack. For example, the retail offerings of digitally advanced multinational banks far outstrip those of local credit unions.\nAs technology transforms business models and processes, it is also changing the way employees work. Recent McKinsey research finds that already-proven technologies could automate as much as 45% of the tasks individuals are currently paid to perform. In the US alone, that is the equivalent of about $2 trillion in annual wages.\nThe potential benefits of this transformation for companies extend far beyond cost savings, as workers gain time to pursue more valuable tasks involving critical thinking and creativity. Financial advisers can spend less time analysing financials and more time developing solutions that meet clients\u2019 needs. Or interior decorators can shift their attention from taking measurements to devising design concepts, meeting with clients, or sourcing materials.\nTechnology also allows companies to rethink conventional wisdom on organizational design and governance. New information-sharing technologies deliver greater transparency, making organizations more efficient and, in many cases, less hierarchical.\nFor example, the CEOs of Apple, Inditex (a multinational clothing company) and Zappos (a large online retailer) have adopted broad spans of control (the number of subordinates directly reporting to a manager) that far exceed the traditional model of \u201cone to four to eight\". Haier, the Chinese white-goods manufacturer, reorganized its 80,000-person workforce into 2,000 independent units, each responsible for managing its own profits and losses. Since the move, its market capitalization has soared, tripling from 2011 to 2014.\nMoreover, digitization allows companies to operate as \u201cplatforms\", not structures, and make greater use of resources outside their company. Insurance company Allstate used the crowdsourcing platform Kaggle to invite programmers to develop a new car accident injury algorithm; the eventual \u201cwinner\" was 271% more accurate than its existing model.\nLikewise, China\u2019s DJI became the world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer by focusing on its products\u2019 core technology, while giving away developer kits for free online so that others could build apps. This approach meant that DJI\u2019s drones were equipped with attractive features far earlier than competitors\u2019 products,", "baseline_completion": "which relied on in-house app development.\nSimilar technology-driven innovations in thought processes and business models can be seen across the economy, reflected in changes in companies\u2019 planning processes. Some have begun creating separate business plans with two-month and 20-year views, reallocating their resources more aggressively, and using new analytical techniques to identify, attract, develop and retain talent.\nTechnological innovation enables\u2014indeed, requires\u2014companies to boost their agility and thus their competitiveness. That\u2019s why CEOs\u2019 top priorities in 2016 should be to digitize the core components of their business and rethink organizational design and governance processes. Catching this fast-moving\u2014and rapidly growing\u2014\u201cdigital wave\" is the only way to avoid getting left behind.\nDominic Barton is the global managing director of McKinsey & Company.", "orig_sample_length": 1293, "prompt_length": 1093, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "such as the ability to see from the drone\u2019s camera while hovering, and to avoid obstacles using infrared sensors.\nThe speed and scale of technological change have taxed even the most experienced managers. But we have seen that digital technologies are helping companies to reinvent themselves in radical new ways. Those that can leverage these technologies to enhance their core offerings, reimagine their business models, and harness their talent more effectively will continue to succeed.\nRead about the Digital Quotient, a new measure of digital maturity and how it helps organizations identify and execute on digital opportunities.", "w_wm_output": "helping the company leap ahead of rivals.\nDigital technology is having a profound effect on the world\u2019s business models. It is allowing incumbent companies to adopt new ways of generating and distributing value in a more dynamic environment. But digital technology also means incumbents will have to work harder. They\u2019ll need to develop a more granular understanding of customers\u2019 needs, become more nimble and agile, and be more creative in their development of new business models.\nIn the end, however, the only way to remain relevant in a digital world is to embrace disruptive innovation. Companies have spent the past 20 years deploying a variety of digital solutions, and many have generated compelling returns. As the business ecosystem becomes increasingly digital, however, the time has come to embrace a much more aggressive approach.

But Jacobsen, a consultant who advises businesses \u2013 primarily convenience stores \u2013 on where best to locate, said it will overall hurt the businesses in Washoe City. He said that applies especially to convenience stores, the gas station and businesses like the Chocolate Factory and Nevada Lynn Emporium which rely on impulse buyers seeing them and deciding to stop.\nHe said Paul Marazzo, owner of Washoe Flats restaurant \u2013 formerly the Cattleman\u2019s \u2013 may benefit because his is a destination rather than an impulse stop.\nMarazzo is counting on that.

And, as the valley develops, he said he\u2019ll get more and more local business.\nAt the same time, he said the freeway will make it easier for people to come to his restaurant because they\u2019ll be able to take the freeway to Parker Ranch Road just south of the restaurant.\nAnd in the meantime, he said the freeway construction crews are excellent customers.\nShe said traffic is the issue and she has been involved in efforts to get people to slow down through the valley.\nTyson Petty, manager of Old Washoe Station, the gas station and mini-mart to the north, made similar comments.\nCouch and Petty both said their businesses may be hurt somewhat but neither thought the loss of traffic would put them out of business.", "orig_sample_length": 470, "prompt_length": 270, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ay, it will mean a rush of customers to his restaurant.\nTwo months ago, when the restaurant was in its last weeks as Cattleman\u2019s, Marazzo said he would have said the new freeway would hurt his businesses. He said he\u2019d just taken over the restaurant and was preparing to open it as Washoe Flats.\nBut he said he\u2019s been impressed with the way the NDOT has handled the project, to the point of allowing him to keep the old Cattleman\u2019s sign in place.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been really good to work with,\u201d Marazzo said.\nMarazzo said he has been told by NDOT engineers that the freeway will be finished by Dec. 31. The current schedule calls for the freeway to be open to traffic by the first week of December.\nMarazzo said many of the businesses on Highway 395 and W", "w_wm_output": "ay, he expects to see a business increase.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the works,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for us.\u201d But he said he\u2019s had some hard times the past year, and he expects the business will continue to grow.\n\u201cThis is a great location for a bar and restaurant,\u201d he said.\nIn the business park, the Nevada Highway Patrol has a substation.

The FBI's victims' suit against the officers who wronged them can proceed to the next step.\nHaving decided the lawsuit can continue, the Appeals Court decides it doesn't need to reach a finding on the agents' qualified immunity assertions. This will be handled on remand by the lower court, which will first have to make this decision before deciding what (if any) damages the plaintiffs are entitled to.\nThis is far from a victory for the plaintiffs but it does open the door for similar lawsuits against federal officers for harassment and intimidation tactics deployed in hopes of turning lawful residents and visitors into government informants.

{"idx": 223, "truncated_input": "I previously wrote an article stating that the Texas Primary Elections will likely be split with one in March and the other in May. This is what the Texas Republican Party and the AG argued for.\nNot everyone likes that idea though, and there are many who want only one Primary election date, including both Democrats and a good number of Republican State Senators and Texas Congressmen.\nWe will find out soon from the San Antonio Federal Court whether we will have two Texas Primaries (one in March and One in May) of whether ALL the Primary Elections in Texas will be pushed back to a later day, likely in May.\nI certainly understand some of the reasons for not wanting to have a split Primary, including the extra costs and confusion. I also completely respect the opinions of the State Senators and Congressmen who are for just one later primary date. I do have concerns that this later primary election will devastate the Texas Vote in the Presidential Primary Election.\nA HUGE drawback of pushing back all the primary Elections in Texas would be that it would hurt the ability of Texas to choose the next Republican Presidential Candidate in what would be the biggest election against the Democrats in the History of America.\nRight now, Texas is in position to have a major say in the Republican Presidential Primary election. A later primary Election would give Texas nearly no chance of having a major impact on who the Republican Presidential Candidate will be.\nThe RNC made a rule that if certain states had their primary Elections before March 2012 and February 2012, then those state would lose HALF of their Presidential Primary Delegates. Well, most of the states that have primary elections before Texas have not complied with this rule and therefore those States will lose half of their Republican Presidential Primary Election Delegate Votes.

This is one reason why the Texas Primary should not be postponed.\nAnother reason why the Texas Primary should not be postponed is because Texas will have a very important Vote for a potential V.P.

{"idx": 225, "truncated_input": "VIENNA \u2013 A senior U.N. official announced progress Friday in long-stalled efforts to resume a probe of suspicions that Iran may have worked to develop nuclear arms, saying the investigation could be restarted by early next year.\nHe acknowledged that a key IAEA request -- a visit to a site linked to suspected nuclear activity --was again denied. But he told reporters at Vienna airport that he expected IAEA experts to be allowed to go to Parchin and follow up on suspicions it might have been used as part of secret arms-related experiments once the probe is resumed.\nIn Tehran, Iran&apos;s state TV made no mention of progress, reporting only that there was no agreement on visiting Parchin. But Iranian envoy Ali Asghar Soltanieh also said a new meeting was set for Jan. 16.\nWhile Nackaerts&apos; comments gave cause for some optimism, they were not the first instance of a senior IAEA official saying that the standoff was close to resolution.\nReturning from Tehran talks more than five months ago, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said the two sides had agreed on \"an almost clean text\", saying a breakthrough deal would be signed soon. Follow-up IAEA-Iran meetings did not yield significant results.\nIran says it does not want atomic arms and has justified a nearly yearlong delay in cooperating with the IAEA&apos;s probe by saying that a framework regulating such an investigation must be agreed on first. But as talks on such an agreement have dragged on, agency officials have complained that they may be nothing more than a delaying tactic.\nThey are particularly concerned that such delays can hurt their efforts to investigate Parchin. The IAEA suspects that Iran has conducted live tests of conventional explosives there that could be used to detonate a nuclear charge and cited satellite photos indicating a cleanup of the site, at a sprawling military base southeast of Tehran.\nIran denies it is sanitizing the site, but Amano has warned that his agency&apos;s chances of a meaningful investigation there are diminishing.\nNackaerts offered no details on the substance of his talks. But diplomats familiar with the negotiations have said previously that the agreement was stalled because the IAEA wanted repeated access to sites, officials or documents of interest. Instead, Tehran demanded that once such access was granted, the person, document or site be off limits to the IAEA for repeated visits, questioning of viewing.\nAmano&apos;s announcement of a nearly done deal in May came just days before the two sides met in Baghdad for a new round of negotiations meant to defuse tensions over Iran&apos;s nuclear program before leaving the negotiating table with little progress made.\nThis time, Nackaerts spoke of movement on the probe as Iran and six world powers again prepare to meet. The", "baseline_completion": "six nations hope the talks will result in an agreement by the Islamic Republic to stop enriching uranium to a higher level that could be turned relatively quickly into the fissile core of nuclear arms.\nIran denies such aspirations insisting it is enriching only to make reactor fuel and to make isotopes for medical purposes.\nBy compromising on the IAEA probe, Iran could argue that the onus was now on the six powers to show some flexibility, temper their demands, and roll back U.S. and European sanctions that have hit Iran&apos;s critical oil exports and blacklisted the country from international banking networks.\nThe IAEA has already visited Parchin twice -- the last time in 2005.

{"idx": 226, "truncated_input": "Happy Sunday. FRONT PAGE EDITORIAL -- BIRMINGHAM NEWS, HUNTSVILLE TIMES, PRESS-REGISTER (MOBILE) -- \u201cSTAND FOR DECENCY, REJECT ROY MOORE\u201d: \u201cThis election is a turning point for women in Alabama. A chance to make their voices heard in a state that has silenced them for too long.\n\u201cDuring the phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Ryan, who had campaigned heavily for Mr. Johnson in 2016, posed an essential question, according to the senator: \u2018What are you going to need?\u2019 What Mr. Johnson needs \u2026 is for the bill to treat more favorably small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities -- businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at rates for individuals. Such entities, including Mr. Johnson\u2019s family-run plastics manufacturing business, account for more than half of the nation\u2019s business income, and the senator says the tax bill would give an unfair advantage to larger corporations.\n-- IT\u2019S WORTH NOTING: This is hardly the first time Johnson has clashed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his GOP leadership team. He also fought with them over how the Obamacare repeal process played out. He is just the first Senate Republican out of the gate opposing the bill. Just because the House GOP tax overhaul was on the fast track and didn\u2019t face many hiccups, don\u2019t expect the same to be true in the Senate.\nFOR EXAMPLE\u2026 JAKE TAPPER talks with SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-MAINE) on CNN\u2019S \u201cSTATE OF THE UNION: TAPPER: \u201cYou said this week that Republicans made a big mistake when they changed the tax bill to include this repeal of the Affordable Care Act individual mandate because that -- removing that could raise taxes or payment -- health care payments, premiums, for millions of Americans. If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a \u2018no\u2019 vote from you?\u201d COLLINS: \u201cWell, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bill said we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that\u2019s \u2026 disproportionately 80 percent on those who make under $50,000.\nMORE TAX DRAMA IN THE STATES -- \u201cIn Democrat-led state capitals, GOP tax reform push could scramble fiscal plans,\u201d by Laura Nahmias in New York, Katherine Landergan in New Jersey and Carla Marinucci in California: \u201cThe Republican tax reform push in Washington is setting off budgetary alarm bells in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey, in the latest political skirmish to pit national Republicans against Democratic state and big city leaders.\n\u201cWith Republicans intent on shrinking or repealing the state and local tax deduction, California officials are worried that the House-passed tax bill, and the emerging Senate measure, will force local governments to reduce taxes and make big cuts to schools and social services. In New York, where New York City and state revenues are heavily reliant on just a handful of wealthy tax filers, budget watchdogs fear federal tax changes could trigger the flight of those residents. And in New Jersey, plans for a new millionaire\u2019s tax, one of incoming Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s biggest campaign promises, are already being reined in as the Democratic-led New Jersey Senate waits on the outcome of any federal tax plan.\nTROUBLE FOR FRANKEN -- A1 of the STAR TRIBUNE -- \u201cSidelined by scandal, Sen. Al Franken faces questions about ability to do his job,\u201d by Jennifer Brooks and Erin Golden: \u201cSuddenly a senator whose statewide approval rating stood at 58 percent in the last Star Tribune Minnesota Poll is facing calls to resign \u2014 even from prominent Minnesota DFLers and deeply disappointed supporters.\n-- TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN?: STAR LEDGER FRONT PAGE: \u201cWhy this N.J. Republican keeps voting for things that could hurt Jersey\u201d (print headline: \u201cMacArthur is showing affinity for risk-taking: Representative\u2019s tax stance could hurt N.J., his future\u201d): \u201cIn just his third term in office, Rep. Tom MacArthur is helping to shape legislation in a way lawmakers who've been here a long time can only dream of.\nBUT, BUT, BUT -- EMILY HOLDEN in Bonn, Germany: \u201cThe White House goaded activists at the international climate talks by pushing coal and other fossil fuels. But behind closed doors, U.S. negotiators stuck to their Obama-era principles on the 2015 Paris deal \u2014 despite President Donald Trump\u2019s disavowal of the pact. State Department negotiators at the U.N. conference that ended Saturday hewed to the United States\u2019 long-established positions on the details of how to carry out the Paris agreement. And that's the U.S. role that most foreign political leaders sought to highlight, despite the low expectations inspired by Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda and his dismissal of human-caused climate change as a hoax.\n-- TONIGHT ON \u201cKASIE D.C.\u201d: Sen.

Barry McCaffrey and Azmat Khan.\nGREAT STORY -- SCOTT BROWN IN NEW ZEALAND -- \u201cScott Brown\u2019s pay is $155,000 per year. The benefits are priceless,\u201d by the Boston Globe\u2019s Joshua Miller in Wellington, New Zealand: \u201cOf the waves that followed from Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 tsunami, Brown\u2019s ascension from the everyman-with-a-pickup who lost two U.S. Senate races in two years in two states to US ambassador to New Zealand ranks among the most unlikely. And, for him, the most fortunate.\n\u201cThe island nation is a paradisiacal land of jade hills dotted with grazing sheep, golden-sand beaches surrounded by Jurassic Park-like jungles, snow-capped peaks that rise steeply from azure fjords, and pastoral villages serving gourmet meals and world-class wine.\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cDon\u2019t trust politicians to solve our problems, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse tells Iowa crowd,\u201d by the Des Moines Register\u2019s Jason Noble: \u201cDon\u2019t look to politics to solve the pressing problems in American culture or address looming technological and economic changes that will rearrange American society, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse told an Iowa audience Saturday. Politicians, he said, simply aren\u2019t up to the task.\nSPOTTED: Sen.

{"idx": 227, "truncated_input": "Under intense pressure to improve conditions in the jail complex on Rikers Island, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio has developed a plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds to a dedicated jail for youths in the Bronx.\nThe cost to carry out the plan is expected to be about $300 million, officials said.\nThe plan calls for the city to reconfigure the Horizon Juvenile Center, which is currently used to hold 14- and 15-year olds, to house the 16- and 17-year olds who are typically sent to Rikers.\nA 2015 settlement with the Department of Justice on reform at Rikers called on the city to seek an alternative location to house inmates under 18, although it stopped short of requiring it.\nNew York is the only state other than North Carolina that prosecutes all children 16 and older as adults if they are accused of a crime. In New York City, they are likely to wind up at Rikers, a notoriously brutal lockup. There are currently about 200 inmates who are 16 or 17 at Rikers, down from about 330 in 2013.\nThe city and many advocates have urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would treat those under the age of 18 as juveniles, but the proposal has gone nowhere in Albany.\nThe new plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers must overcome several hurdles. It has to be approved through the city\u2019s time-consuming land use process: The local community board and the Bronx borough president get to weigh in and it must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.\nBut the change will not happen any time soon; officials said it could take four years or more to get approvals and to complete construction. The plan also calls for the city to remodel another juvenile detention site, the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold all of the city\u2019s 14- and 15-year-old detainees, including those who had previously gone to Horizon.\nThe cost of refurbishing the Bronx center is budgeted at $170 million. The cost of remodeling the Brooklyn center is budgeted at $129 million.\nAdvocates supported the move but lamented the long delay before the new center will be ready, assuming that it survives the land-use review process.\n\u201cFor us this is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d he said.\nMore than 95 percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds at Rikers are awaiting trial.", "baseline_completion": "More than a third have been charged with robbery and about one in 10 have been charged with assault, according to data provided by the city.\nIncreased attention was focused on the plight of younger teenagers at Rikers in 2014 after The New Yorker published an article about Kalief Browder, who was sent there at 16, accused of stealing a backpack. He never stood trial or was found guilty of any crime but he spent three years at Rikers, nearly two of them in solitary confinement. He told of being beaten repeatedly by guards and other inmates and trying several times to kill himself while in custody. After his release he remained deeply troubled by the experience and he committed suicide last year at age 22.\nThe city ended solitary confinement for Rikers inmates under 18 in December 2014.", "orig_sample_length": 831, "prompt_length": 631, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "The Justice Department settlement, in addition to requiring that the city close Rikers within two years, says the city need to keep all youths who are awaiting trial in community-based facilities.\nThe city must also make sure that all juveniles on Rikers are released within 24 hours of a court appearance, and that no juveniles are held for more than 28 days.\nThe city\u2019s plan calls for creating separate facilities for the young men and for the young women, and for keeping the 16- and 17-year-olds away from the 18- to 21-year-olds, as called for in the settlement.\nThe city\u2019s plan also calls for creating a new jail for 14- and 15-year-olds on the site of the Crossroads center in Brooklyn.

{"idx": 228, "truncated_input": "Unprecedented back-to-back annual coral bleaching events have affected two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef, with this year's event already leading to mortality of half the corals in some key tourist tracts, scientists say.\nRecord-breaking warm waters along the Queensland coast has triggered widespread bleaching over 1500 kilometres of the World-Heritage-listed reef over the two summers, said Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.\nProfessor Hughes and his team completed aerial surveys last Wednesday after scoring about 800 separate reefs. The 8000km journey closely followed the path of the 2016 survey that found the northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef most affected.\n\"It's been a huge blow to the reef after last year the northern third was hit and now this year's it's the middle third,\" Professor Hughes said.\nCorals bleach when temperatures exceed tolerance levels for too long, prompting them to expel the algae that supply most of their energy and the brilliant colours. Not all bleached corals die but as much as two-thirds of north corals have succumbed.\n\"The mortality in the central region will continue to unfold over coming months,\" Professor Hughes said. \"We've already seen substantial mortality, up to 50 per cent on some central reefs in the past six weeks.\"\nBleaching has returned even to some of the regions hard hit last year, such as Cape York's Princess Charlotte Bay.\nSome 30 reefs in the north had no score as they \"effectively have ceased to exist at least in the shallow sections as coral reefs\", said James Kerry, a marine biologist from James Cook University who also took part in the survey.\nWhile this year's event is not expected to result in as much coral mortality as in 2016, there are worrying signs corals bleached at lower temperatures than a year earlier. That result may point to more bleaching next summer if conditions are again relatively warm.\n\"It seemed like the bleaching happened more quickly this year, which may suggest they are in a weakened, more stressed state following last year's event,\" Dr Kerry said.\nMark Read, manager of operations support at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said \"2017 has shaped up to be a pretty nasty year when it comes to coral bleaching\".\n\"The corals didn't get any respite at all,\" Dr Read said.\nBleaching, though, was patchy. The authority was already in talks with tour operators to redirect visitors to \"refugia\" where they can still enjoy \"a high-quality experience\", he said.\nSuch areas are likely to be harder to find in the Whitsunday region near Mackay where Cyclone Debbie carved a swathe about 100km wide through the reefs.\n\"The one area that was actually doing pretty good was the one that bore the brunt of the category 4 cyclone,\" Dr Read said. \"A lot of those massive corals are now lying on the beach in those locations. They've simply been snapped and rolled up onto the beach.\"\nTemperatures are showing signs of easing back to more typical levels for this time of year, such as the Davies Reef off Townsville.\nBut the area had been remarkably warm even in a non-El Nino year, such as during the previous 2015-16 summer.\nIn March, for instance, large areas of Queensland reported their hottest mean temperatures on record.

{"idx": 229, "truncated_input": "Editor\u2019s Note: A few weeks ago, we ran a provocative piece by Stephen Watts and Sean Mann in which they argued that in both its politics and in its development, Afghanistan is doing better than is commonly believed. Gary Owen, a civilian development worker who has spent the last several years working on the ground in Afghanistan, begs to differ. He paints a far gloomier picture of Afghanistan, arguing that the country and U.S. policy have a long way to go.\nMany Americans are surprisingly bullish on Afghanistan, and this perspective showed up in a July Lawfare post on \u201cAfghanistan After the Drawdown\u201d by RAND analysts Stephen Watts and Sean Mann. Although the two authors offer some valid points, they miss many of the country\u2019s problems and, in so doing, are wrongly optimistic about where Afghanistan is going.\nAfter a decade and more of U.S. intervention, it can be difficult to pin down how things are going in Afghanistan. By some measures, things in Afghanistan are better: There are more children in school than there were under the Taliban, more Afghans have access to basic healthcare than before the 2001 invasion, and Internet access means more connections to the outside world than was ever possible during the time of the black turbans. Watts and Mann cite those cases as reasons to be optimistic about the country, and rightly so. Where they go wrong is in three key areas: relations with Pakistan, the current government as a symbol of Afghan unity, and the abilities of Afghan security forces.\nPakistan\u2019s got plenty to worry about when it comes to sanctuaries within its own borders, a grim point made by last year\u2019s school shooting in Peshawar. And recent revelations that Mullah Omar died in Pakistan, and his whereabouts were known to the ISI for years, don\u2019t paint a picture of Afghanistan being used as a base to launch operations against Pakistan. Instead it speaks to Pakistan\u2019s harboring of the Taliban with the government\u2019s knowledge, something Islamabad is scrambling to correct as they look ahead to peace talks with the Taliban.\nOr it\u2019s just a case of Afghanistan following the American lead.\nIn the fall of 2014, after another runoff election threatened to bring the country\u2019s democratic future to a grinding halt, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed a group made up of Abdullah\u2019s leadership team. According to an administration official, Kerry told the group, \u201cI have to emphasize to you that if you do not have an agreement, if you do not move to a unity government, the United States will not be able to support Afghanistan.\u201d Aimed squarely at those who supported Abdullah to the point that they might take up arms in his name, Kerry\u2019s statement was an offer neither Ghani nor Abdullah could possibly refuse. The current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThe current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThanks to advances by the Taliban in Faryab and Kunduz, influential politicians like Rashid Dostum (currently Ghani\u2019s vice president) and Atta Noor (the powerful governor of Balkh province) have been pretty vocal in their thinking that Afghan forces alone can\u2019t get the job done; that to tip the balance means more troops from somewhere\u2014either the Americans (not out of the question completely, but unlikely), or some kind of militia. Since today\u2019s anti-Taliban militia could be tomorrow\u2019s coup attempt, it lays some troubling groundwork for widening existing divides in the country that the United States had hoped the Ghani/Abdullah deal would help bridge. Unless they can manage to bring the security situation that\u2019s deteriorating faster than Iggy Azalea\u2019s career back under control, Afghan troops could have some new bosses very soon. Their current performance doesn\u2019t inspire much hope.\nActually, it\u2019s pretty clear how those forces will perform. In a word? Badly.\nSince the Afghans assumed control of the country\u2019s security in 2014, more civilians have been killed, more soldiers have died, more Afghan troops have deserted than ever before, and security forces are still torturing one-third of their detainees. This is the force Watts and Mann describe as \u201cpassably capable\u201d and \u201cresilient.\u201d If by \u201cpassably capable\u201d they mean \u201cdoesn\u2019t torture too many people,\u201d then sure, I suppose they are \u201cpassably capable,\u201d but I think we might want to aim just a bit higher.\nAccording to the Americans, civilian casualties as a result of ground engagements between the Afghans and insurgents were up eight percent for the first three months of 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. In June, Afghan Chief of Army Staff Gen. Qadam Shah Shaheem told his troops that using artillery and conducting night raids against the insurgents was just fine, and no one would be prosecuted as a result. Since most engagements occur among the population when one is countering an insurgency, this change in the rules of engagement means more innocent civilians are going to die as the result of actions by Afghan security forces. That\u2019s borne out by the latest report on civilian casualties from UNAMA, which found that throughout the first half of 2015, Afghan forces caused more civilian casualties than the Taliban did.\nAnd when they\u2019re not busy leveling villages, Afghan forces are dying in record numbers. Throughout the first five months of 2015, security forces casualties were up 70 percent from the same period in 2014. Some of that\u2019s attributable to increasing activity by the insurgents, but a \u201ccapable\u201d force doesn\u2019t see that kind of casualty increase unless its capabilities are less than optimal. Even so, the biggest cause of attrition for Afghan troops isn\u2019t being killed in action (KIA). According to a June report by the Americans to Congress, the largest source for attrition is \u201cdropped from rolls\u201d (wherein a soldier stops showing up for work for more than a month so he\u2019s no longer counted), and KIA is the smallest source for Afghan force attrition.\nBut when they do manage to not die and to show up for work, Afghan forces like to spend some quality time with their detainees. A February report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that while torture is on the decrease, around 35 percent of all detainees surveyed reported being tortured in detention. Much of that alleged torture was at the hands of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is similar to the FBI, except that the FBI has better windbreakers and isn\u2019t prone to hooking people up to car batteries unnecessarily. That probably explains why the Americans made it clear in June that no U.S. funds were going to the NDS, even though nearly every other aspect of Afghan defense operations comes directly from American coffers and internal defense is vital for the success of the counterinsurgency.\nIn an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren\u2019t dying in greater numbers, the government isn\u2019t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019s the country the Americans promised them.\nAn American solution to Afghanistan\u2019s problems faces the struggles of a dwindling security force to keep the Taliban at bay as they strike from sanctuaries in Pakistan, a government on", "baseline_completion": "the verge of collapse, and large numbers of civilians being victimized by their own government.

The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019s the country the Americans promised them.\nThe reality is that that Afghanistan\u2019s future, while grim, is still better than it was. There is cause for cautious optimism. That does not mean that we shouldn\u2019t be painfully honest about what\u2019s happening in Afghanistan.

The country\u2019s problems are not intractable, but they are familiar, as the well-documented fates of other failed states show. The current approach simply isn\u2019t working, and the solution lies in a reconsideration of strategy, not a change in tactics.\nThe United States\u2019 initial strategy of containment was a success, but Afghanistan doesn\u2019t need to be contained.

They also temporarily forestalled a deep cut in doctors' Medicare fees that threatened to make it harder for the elderly to find physicians who would treat them. Now, the two sides need to figure out how to extend all three measures through 2012 and cover the roughly $160 billion cost.\nQ: Are they expected to succeed?\nA: Yes, though it will probably take until shortly before the current extensions expire Feb. 29. There are complicated decisions ahead, chiefly what programs to cut and what fees to increase to offset the price tag. Just as important, Democrats won't be in a hurry to finish.\nA: Republicans took a severe pounding in December when the House GOP resisted a bipartisan, Senate-approved, two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, which was designed to give lawmakers time to negotiate a longer version. With control of the White House and Congress at stake in the November elections, many Democrats think the GOP could incur further damage if these latest talks take time.\nMany Republicans doubt the economic benefit of a payroll tax cut, a foundation of Obama's plan to create jobs. But as December's battle unfolded, GOP leaders worried that they would suffer political damage from opposing the deeply popular tax cut, worth $1,000 annually to a family earning $50,000 a year.\nWith the House's fractious conservative wing balking until the very end, the fight made the GOP look like it was opposing the tax reduction -- which Democrats contrasted with Republican support for tax breaks for the wealthy. Most Republicans want this year's fight to end quickly so they can change the subject to their own efforts to cut taxes, federal spending and Obama administration regulations.\nQ: How long can Democrats prolong the negotiations?\nA: If they're not careful they could overplay their hand.\nDemocrats scored points last year by forcing Senate votes on their proposal to finance the payroll tax cut with a small surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year. They have a new incentive to do something similar this year with the GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, a wealthy venture capitalist, being cast by party rivals as callous and out of touch.\nAs a result, many Democrats want to begin this year's talks on extending the Social Security tax cut by targeting the wealthy for a tax increase, perhaps with the millionaire surtax or by limiting their deductions. The millionaire surtax has no chance of passage in the GOP-run House, and Democrats could be accused of blatantly playing politics. Democrats and Obama have a reason to cut a deal: They believe extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits will goose the economy and reduce the risk of another economic downturn that could hurt their election prospects.\nQ; What will the 20 members of Congress do?\nA: House and Senate party leaders each have appointed bargainers to hash out differences over the bill, following Congress' tradition of naming conference committees to craft compromise legislation. But as usual when high-profile battles are being resolved, party leaders will have tight control over the ultimate deal. Still, conference committee members will play a role in writing details, and their endorsement of a package would let leaders argue that they didn't jam something down the throats of rank-and-file lawmakers.\nQ: Who are these 20 lawmakers?\nA: They range from formidable committee chairmen to lowly freshmen, but each has a stake in the fight.\nThe chairmen of Congress' two tax-writing committees are included: Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., of the Senate Finance Committee.\nSen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., is the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, facing re-election this fall in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, has repeatedly been given a visible role in the payroll tax fight by party leaders.\nRep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a party leader, should be a leading opponent of Republican proposals to help finance the plan by effectively denying the child tax credit to many illegal immigrants. Freshman GOP Rep. Nan Hayworth is from a closely contested district in New York's Hudson River Valley.\nHayworth and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., are doctors, which could give them roles in the talks involving Medicare. A pair of Maryland Democrats, Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, are sure to battle a Republican proposal to make federal", "baseline_completion": "employees contribute more to their pensions.\nQ: Do they bring other experience to the bargaining table?\nA: Seven have participated in recent, failed bipartisan efforts to contain mammoth budget deficits. Those were Congress' supercommittee, talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, the \"Group of Six\" senators, and a presidential commission headed by former Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson and former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, Erskine Bowles.\nNone of those groups succeeded, largely because party leaders could not agree to the controversial tax increases and cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare that would have been required for the trillions of dollars in savings needed.\nFar smaller savings are needed to resolve the payroll tax fight, and the consensus is that this time, the president and leaders in both parties want a package that can become law.", "orig_sample_length": 1480, "prompt_length": 1280, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "agencies pay more for Medicare.\nQ: When will they meet?\nA: Next week. The meeting will be closed to the press, but the participants' names will be made public.\nThe 20 won't meet in person. Instead, they'll be able to interact through conference calls.\nQ: What's next?\nA: The lawmakers will be asked to approve a framework for the talks.\nQ: Will they agree on a compromise?\nA: Probably not.\nThey are not expected to settle on a package of offsets, which will be key to agreeing on a final payroll tax cut/jobless benefits bill. Lawmakers are likely to agree on a broad outline of what they want to do, laying out at least the major details of the tax cut and jobless benefits.\nQ: Could they fail?\nA: Yes, though it's not clear how", "w_wm_output": "unemployment benefits taxable, as many are now. They could also oppose any plan that would reduce aid to the poor and disabled.\nQ: Who is the most likely player to become a target of the opposition?\nA: Republicans could be tempted to blame the entire conference committee for a bill that would raise taxes on people making above a million dollars annually. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was a leading voice for the millionaire surtax last year. Expect Democrats to counter with charges that the GOP's proposal to deny the child tax credit to illegal immigrants would have denied benefits to a million children.\nQ: What role could the White House play?\nA: Obama's top priority is securing an extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits before they expire, which would send the economy into a tailspin, Treasury Secretary Tim", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.8926136493682861, 0.3524903953075409, 0.3536728024482727, 0.5759864449501038, 0.8719261288642883, 0.38230809569358826, 0.7729546427726746, 0.8569837808609009, 0.8156909942626953, 0.7060002088546753, 0.5999314785003662, 0.42805707454681396, 0.6065900325775146, 0.8737324476242065, 0.8437719345092773, 0.9289159178733826, 0.3530336320400238, 0.8114997148513794, 0.8711846470832825, 0.5515860319137573, 0.9094036817550659, 0.9545856714248657, 0.8682764768600464, 0.5082239508628845, 0.6975433826446533, 0.7498657703399658, 0.7448086738586426, 0.8903046250343323, 0.7144595980644226, 0.5043535828590393, 0.7584190368652344, 0.36950957775115967, 0.8081546425819397, 0.8307827711105347, 0.9398066997528076, 0.959977388381958, 0.757091224193573, 0.6338014602661133, 0.5116633176803589, 0.9590400457382202, 0.6010758876800537, 0.8908854126930237, 0.6563347578048706, 0.941371738910675, 0.8650121688842773, 0.5142477750778198, 0.35567620396614075, 0.3622468411922455, 0.35624250769615173, 0.9539288282394409, 0.3516215980052948, 0.9002869725227356, 0.946571409702301, 0.915073037147522, 0.3519356846809387, 0.3721742331981659, 0.942185640335083, 0.42853453755378723, 0.8504747152328491, 0.9496023654937744, 0.899113655090332, 0.5015532970428467, 0.6842502355575562, 0.7723552584648132, 0.893900990486145, 0.6354915499687195, 0.9580510854721069, 0.8980969190597534, 0.4679020047187805, 0.36015981435775757, 0.6944369077682495, 0.7418835163116455, 0.6388236284255981, 0.6871682405471802, 0.46553322672843933, 0.43916571140289307, 0.44527411460876465, 0.6919207572937012, 0.3515095114707947, 0.6293337941169739, 0.8980175256729126, 0.36597222089767456, 0.8981516361236572, 0.35193097591400146, 0.5249723792076111, 0.3515094816684723, 0.35163283348083496, 0.47175782918930054, 0.4120634198188782, 0.3520372211933136, 0.35466480255126953, 0.3517066538333893, 0.36372947692871094, 0.8704309463500977, 0.888603150844574, 0.9213869571685791, 0.885010302066803, 0.7682611346244812, 0.8708224296569824, 0.5254157781600952, 0.4175601303577423, 0.4764147400856018, 0.3654177188873291, 0.6965793371200562, 0.40172797441482544, 0.6428772807121277, 0.8610522150993347, 0.35786697268486023, 0.7955671548843384, 0.3515021502971649, 0.3952086269855499, 0.9512378573417664, 0.7186720371246338, 0.878877580165863, 0.4464960992336273, 0.6549133062362671, 0.7138429880142212, 0.35151156783103943, 0.7598475217819214, 0.35225582122802734, 0.9480413198471069, 0.5991237163543701, 0.9154874086380005, 0.3516274690628052, 0.7632551193237305, 0.4120539128780365, 0.3937240242958069, 0.35573601722717285, 0.3911767899990082, 0.6802245378494263, 0.3564681112766266, 0.3516414165496826, 0.3731786608695984, 0.7125675082206726, 0.8354531526565552, 0.7964252233505249, 0.8279006481170654, 0.37839531898498535, 0.8789660930633545, 0.859305739402771, 0.7589263916015625, 0.5643071532249451, 0.5105641484260559, 0.5492467880249023, 0.3655441999435425, 0.8259391784667969, 0.8822804689407349, 0.6397247910499573, 0.7164450287818909, 0.7023377418518066, 0.3516600430011749, 0.4293738007545471, 0.4225368797779083, 0.35482510924339294, 0.3603174388408661, 0.35384827852249146, 0.885067343711853, 0.3517780601978302, 0.8651689291000366, 0.3516477942466736, 0.9546959400177002, 0.8018753528594971, 0.5126675367355347, 0.7476472854614258, 0.41526344418525696, 0.35154733061790466, 0.7690990567207336, 0.5183170437812805, 0.4593045115470886, 0.5830008387565613, 0.5810693502426147, 0.35227271914482117, 0.35794636607170105, 0.4023284912109375, 0.7302677631378174, 0.7144294381141663, 0.35157856345176697, 0.35266152024269104, 0.45752495527267456, 0.7055250406265259, 0.7436293959617615, 0.4332122206687927, 0.35217225551605225, 0.7498157024383545, 0.8496301174163818, 0.7008594274520874, 0.9469470381736755, 0.7083417177200317, 0.6196596622467041, 0.6403031945228577, 0.59764564037323, 0.6357583999633789, 0.35686108469963074, 0.3515133559703827, 0.6440348625183105, 0.8646801710128784, 0.3515141010284424, 0.3515312075614929, 0.4463186264038086, 0.3530133366584778]}

The new government will have to work around this in order to enhance growth measures and reduce austerity levels because austerity on top of austerity will not do the trick. If you keep milking a cow without feeding it you are not going to end up with the desired results.\"\nDespite reservations over Greece's ability to deliver on austerity measures, eurozone finance ministers have given Athens billions of euros to rescue the country from its financial woes.\nReacting to the second tranche of the bailout, Lucas Papademos, the Greek prime minister, described the day as a historic one for the Greek economy.\n\"With today's decisions, we are given an opportunity to move towards more stable conditions, to reduce the uncertainty which has affected the economic activity and enhance confidence in the prospects of the Greek economy,\" he said.\n\"In this way, the adjustment process of the economy can be facilitated and also better conditions for its recovery can be provided and new jobs can be created.\"\nBut some financial experts argue that once again the can has been kicked down the road to be dealt with later.\nThe conditions of the second bailout include $399m cutbacks in military spending, a $40m saving by reducing staff numbers in central government, and reducing the minimum wage, as well as slashing overtime pay for doctors in public hospitals by at least $66m.\nWhat this means is further budget cuts which are already deeply unpopular with the Greek people who have continuously opposed harsh austerity measures imposed following the first bailout in 2010.\n\"The political system has very low credibility and in order to proceed with these tough measures you need to have credible political personnel, which we are lacking right now. Hopefully there will be an inflow of new people from the private sector. There is a huge debate as to whether the major parties will survive this economic crisis.\"\nAs before, eurozone finance ministers say they want assurances Greece will stick to its promises.\nTheir comments were backed by the contents of a leaked report from the European Commission, the Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe report predicts that Greek debt could stay at a staggering 160 per cent of the country's GDP by 2020, unless drastic changes are made.\nCritics say the new measures to bail out struggling countries have to be matched by economic reforms.\nJan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said: \"When you look at the derailments in Greece which have occurred several times now, it is probably necessary that there is some kind of permanent presence of the troika in Athens, not every three months, but more on a permanent basis.

{"idx": 236, "truncated_input": "A Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 Review \u2013 Where Is Walter Jones?\nPENCILLERS: Thony Silas, Corin Howell. Cover by Jamal Campbell.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 tells us that before Tommy became Rita Repulsa\u2019s evil Green Ranger, she made a play for Zack, the Black Ranger. After being \u201cupstaged\u201d by Jason during a fight, Goldar and the putties abduct Zack so Rita can make her pitch. Obviously, Zack doesn\u2019t accept. But how do the events of this issue impact Zack\u2019s relationship to the team? And what happens when Zack tells Zordon?\nRita tempting one of the Rangers toward the dark side is such a simple, classic tale. It\u2019s perfect for this series. I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t have gone with Billy instead of Zack, especially considering the scene we saw in issue #2. He was comparing himself to the others, and he seemed to become self conscious and bitter. If Rita could have seen that, she might have exploited it. On the other hand, we\u2019ve seen some curious behavior from Zack in this series. He\u2019s been very suspicious and apprehensive about Tommy. This issue seems to explain why. This experience gives him a negative connection to the Green Ranger that we never knew about.\nThe Zack we\u2019ve seen in this series isn\u2019t the one I expected. On the show, Walter Jones played a fun-loving dancer. Zack is in love with life, and he\u2019s not afraid to show it. That\u2019s not the character we\u2019ve seen in this series. For the most part he\u2019s been very straight faced. I understand he\u2019s in a very tense storyline. But flashes of personality aren\u2019t going to hurt anything, are they?\nIn essence, what we need in this book is a little more Walter Jones.\nFussy Fanboy Moment: After Zack is abducted, he wakes up in Rita\u2019s Dark Dimension, which we saw in the show. But in one of the \u201cGreen Candle\u201d episodes, which these events obviously predate, Jason says he and Tommy are the only Rangers that have been there.\nOn the plus side, Higgins sneaks in what seems to be a hint at Zack going to the Peace Conference later in the series. He tells Zordon, \u201cI need to do more \u2026 I don\u2019t care about leading. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d I like that second line. It speaks to why Rita\u2019s plan for Zack doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s imperfect like anyone else, but in the end he\u2019s selfless. It\u2019s more about the good that\u2019s being done, as opposed to the glory you get from it.\nThe opening sequence, set in Italy, is a lot of fun. The Rangers face Rita\u2019s monstrous take on The Vitruvian Man, who can apparently only speak in da Vinci quotes. Afterward, they receive some fanfare on the ground. We even have the prime minister in the middle of the action. This is yet another example of Higgins doing something that never could have happened on the show.\nThony Silas tags in on pencils for this issue. His style isn\u2019t dramatically different from Hendry Prasetya\u2019s, though his characters are slightly better at emoting. His Rita is particularly sinister. Again, his Zack seems very reserved and stoic, which is not the character we\u2019re used to.\n\u201cThe Ongoing Adventures of Bulk & Skull\u201d still doesn\u2019t do much for me. Though we do get a surprise in this issue: The BOOM! Studios debut of Lieutenant Stone, Bulk & Skull\u2019s foil from seasons 3 and 4. I\u2019d always been under the impression they\u2019d never met before. Either way, I\u2019m glad to see the putty patroller story is over. On to (hopefully) better things.\nHiggins pleasantly surprised me with this Zack story, by following up on a plot seed he\u2019d planted as far back as issue #1. It makes you wonder what else he might come back to in future issues. Whether it\u2019s how Billy sees his role on the team, Jason feeling threatened by Tommy, or something else fans may have wondered about. There\u2019s so much fertile ground to cover, and I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface.\nThis", "baseline_completion": "entry was posted in Comic Books/Graphic Novels and tagged Billy Cranston, Black Ranger, BOOM!

{"idx": 238, "truncated_input": "The City collects garbage weekly from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes. The City has long organized garbage collection services on a ward-by-ward basis. The City assigns the laborers and motor truck drivers who collect garbage in individual wards, where they work on truck routes that do not cross ward boundaries.\nHowever, the City\u2019s recycling pickup is organized based on a regional routing system that does not take into account ward boundaries.\nUnder this option, the City would shift its garbage collection to a regional, grid-based system. By comparing the efficiency of recycling collection with garbage collection, we can estimate what efficiencies might be achieved through a regional, grid-based system of garbage collection.\nAccording to the City\u2019s Mobile Asset Tracking system (CMAT), the City currently has 43 recycling trucks. Assuming that these trucks are all continually operational, the City is providing recycling services to 241,000 households every other week using 43 daily routes.36 The table below compares the difference in annual pickups per daily route of garbage collection and recycling.\nThe table shows that recycling collection, which uses regional routing, averages significantly more pickups per route than garbage collection, which uses the ward system.\nThis is despite the fact that recycling trucks only have one laborer assigned, while some garbage trucks have two. However, garbage collection averages nearly 11 tons collected per daily route per day, while recycling collection averages only 4.65 tons per daily route per day.\nBecause garbage collection is collecting significantly more tonnage per route, workers spend less time collecting because the trucks must make more frequent trips to dump their loads.\nIn 2008, the average load dumped at City-owned dumpsites was 6.65 tons. Based on the average tons collected per route per day, garbage collection averages 1.65 loads per day and recycling averages 0.7 loads per day.\nFor simplicity, assume that garbage collection dumps two loads per day and recycling dumps one load per day, and one load in each program is dumped after the 8-hour collection shift is over through the City\u2019s night shuttle program.\nUnder these assumptions, garbage collection is interrupted by one dump during the 8-hour collection shift, while recycling collection is not. Assuming an average dump takes 1.5 hours, garbage is collected an average of 6.5 hours per route per day, while recycling is collected for the full 8-hour collection shift.\nThe table below compares the estimated pickups per hour for garbage and recycling collection and shows that recycling collection using regional routing is more efficient in terms of pickups per hour than garbage collection based on the ward system.\nIf garbage collection averaged the same number of pickups per hour as recycling collection, the number of daily routes could be reduced to 264, or a 24.6% reduction.\nAssuming that a 24.6% reduction in routes would yield a 24.6% reduction in staffing devoted to garbage collection, the table below details the reduction in personnel and associated personnel costs that would be realized.\nThe table shows that if the City were to move to a grid-based routing system for garbage collection and achieve the same efficiency that the regional routing of recycling is currently achieving, the City might reduce its 2010 personnel costs by up to $24.1 million through the elimination of up to 297 positions.\nBecause of contractual increases in personnel costs, the savings from implementing this option would grow in future years.\nThe 2011 and 2012 salaries of Laborers and Motor Truck Drivers will be higher due to collective bargaining agreements, which call for salary increases of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012.\nAssuming that there are no increases in salaries for the other positions and that the furloughs are continued in their current form, the table below shows the increase in compensation costs over the next two years for the 297 eliminated positions.\nIn addition to the savings from a reduction in the number of daily routes, additional savings could be generated by reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to one laborer per truck.\nWith 264 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 66,000 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 330 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 66,000 routes.\nThis would mean an additional reduction in the number of laborers by 122. At an average compensation of $75,579, their total compensation in 2010 would equal $9.2 million.\nThe 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 122 positions will cost $9.5 million in 2011 and $9.8 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be slightly reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 122 laborers would on average result in 122 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $856,000 in 2011 and $885,000 in 2012.\nAdditionally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off the 269 total sanitation laborers and 110 motor truck drivers, the affected employees would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $3.8 million.\nTherefore, the total estimated savings from switching to regional routing system of garbage collection and reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to 1 would be $29.6 million in 2011 and $34.5 million in 2012.\nOf course, there would be additional savings from reducing the City\u2019s fleet of garbage trucks such as savings in future truck purchases, maintenance costs, gas, oil, etc.\nProponents might argue that organizing garbage collection on a ward-by-ward basis is inefficient and wasteful. They would argue that organizing collection by regional grid would reduce the time it takes for workers to get from the ward yard to the routes and routes could be organized to reduce the distance from route to dumpsite.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform. Additionally, they might cite the fact that Streets and Sanitation decided to organize recycling collection on a regional, grid-based system in order to deliver the service more cheaply.\nOpponents might argue that ward-based system provides better customer service than a more centralized grid system.\nWith ward-by-ward service, City residents have a more direct relationship with the City workers who coordinate garbage collection in their neighborhoods. Some might also argue that garbage collection has long been a primary responsibility of the City\u2019s aldermen and that this has resulted in cleaner streets, timelier pickups, and satisfied residents.\nReduce the Number of Laborers on a Garbage Truck to 1 Savings: $10.3 million in 2011, $12 million in 2012.\nOn some of the City\u2019s garbage trucks, the City assigns two laborers and one motor truck driver.... These employees are responsible for the weekly collection of garbage from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes.\nUntil the last couple of years, the City generally assigned two laborers to each garbage truck. However, due to budget cuts, the City has reduced the number of budgeted sanitation laborers from 816 in 2008 to 599 in 2010. This reduction in laborers means that a significant portion of the 350 daily routes are manned by one laborer.\nUnder this option, the City would further reduce the number of laborers devoted to garbage collection, so that on average one laborer is assigned to each garbage truck.\nWith 350 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 87,500 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 438 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 87,500 routes.\nThis means that the number of laborers could be reduced by approximately 161.50 At an average compensation of $75,579 their total compensation in 2010 would equal $12.2 million. The 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 161 positions will cost $12.6 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 161 laborers would on average result in 161 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $934,000 in 2011 and $967,000 in 2012.\nFinally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off 161 laborers, the affected laborers would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $1.36 million.\nAfter subtracting the reduced savings due to the increased pay for 1-person garbage trucks and the furlough payback provision, the savings from implementing this option would be approximately $10.3 million in 2011 and $12 million in 2012.\nProponents might argue that the City no longer needs two laborers on a garbage truck because the trucks are now semi-automated, meaning garbage carts are lifted and dumped by a mechanism on the back of the trucks.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform.\nOthers might argue that few cities have three staff assigned to each garbage truck. According to 2008 data from the International City/County Management Association\u2019s (ICMA), among the six jurisdictions with over 500,000 people which submitted data only one (San Antonio) had 3 staff per garbage vehicle, and this is likely because collection is done manually.\nThe other five jurisdictions (Phoenix, Miami-Dade County, Dallas, Austin, and Oklahoma City) all had 1 person per vehicle and automated or semi-automated collection.\nOpponents might argue that reducing the number of laborers to one on all garbage trucks would reduce the quality of collection service in the City. They would argue that reducing the number of laborers could result in less frequent service as it takes trucks longer to perform their routes.\nAdditionally, others might argue that in addition to their collection responsibilities, laborers sweep alleys, pick up trash, or remove street-sweeping signs. Reducing the number of laborers would mean a reduction in these services.\nSimple. Organize the wards on a grid system, rather than gerrymandered as they are now. Makes the garbage collection more efficient, while keeping it in the hands of the aldermen.\nThe trucks on the Far North Side are picking up less garbage than a year ago.\nI know this because while they're leaving the garage on Ravenswood Ave. at the same time every morning, they're coming back for the day way before they used to. Now they return as early as 2 PM, while a year ago it was at 3 PM. All the workers cars are gone by 3 PM now, it used to take until 4 PM last year.\nThe only explanation for the ward by ward system appears to be the very least paragraph which to me seems pretty flimsy. How are the residents' or aldermen's relationships with the city workers stronger if they don't cross ward boundaries on any given day? They still have to pick up their garbage every week? I don't get that at all.\n---I also found it interesting that the city apparently picks up about twice the tonnage of trash than it does recycling. In the superboonies where I live, the ratio is more than twice the opposite. We have two wheeled containers for each house; one for recycling, and a somewhat larger one for trash. We fill the recycling container each week, and the trash container has a few things in the bottom of it; some garbage, contaminated paper not suitable for recycling, used facial tissues, the occasional diaper when the grandchildren come visiting. The city's ratio is possibly a residuum of the blue bag program; people just aren't used to a serious recycling program yet.\nAnd oh yes: the collection trucks have a claw on the side that picks up the container, upends it and dumps it. One man per truck, and he never has to get out.\nCut down on high absenteeism while you're at it.\nI lived in Chicago until 1975 and knew that if you wanted to guarantee that the old loveseat or refrigerator that you hauled out to your alley were to be picked up it was a good idea to meet the garbage truck with maybe a cold six pack in a brown bag or possibly a $5 bill discreetly passed to the driver. Actually, you could give it to any one of the three or", "baseline_completion": "four 'workers' who either drove, rode on the back of, or walked along behind, the truck. Since then I've lived in the suburbs (Alsip, Justice, Worth, Lockport) and have enjoyed simple, cost effective trash collection by various private refuse companies. I have never, in more than 35 years, had to call to complain about the service I've received. This includes picking up couchs, freezers, construction waste or trees.

{"idx": 239, "truncated_input": "Az Zallaqa, JNIM\u2019s media branch, branded with other official al Qaeda media wings.\nIn a recently released video, the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) \u2013 a jihadist group primarily based in West Africa and the Sahel \u2013 went to great lengths to portray its fight against Mali and France as conjoined with al Qaeda\u2019s global jihad. Speeches and footage from several al Qaeda leaders from around the world were shown interlaced with combat footage from the African jihadist group.\nAt the very beginning of the video, JNIM showed its media division, Az Zallaqa, as being in the same family as other al Qaeda media wings. This includes As Sahab (al Qaeda central\u2019s media division), Al Malahem (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), Al Kata\u2019ib (Shabaab), and al Andalus (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). By putting its media wing alongside other media branches of the global jihadist organization, JNIM is portraying Az Zallaqa as another official al Qaeda media organization.\nThis is important as some have categorized JNIM as merely being \u201clinked\u201d or \u201caffiliated\u201d with al Qaeda. However, JNIM clearly sees itself on equal footing with al Qaeda\u2019s official branches around the world.\nAs the video progresses, JNIM depicts its conflict in Mali as being the same conflict seen in various places around the world, such as Nigeria, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. Various killed al Qaeda leaders, such as Osama bin Laden, Nasir al Wuyashi, Anwar al Awlaki, Ibn Khattab, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, Abu al Hasan al Rashid al Bulaydi, Abdelhamid Abu Zeid, Abu Firas al Suri, and Muhammad al Zahawi, are shown in a eulogy segment.\nA speech from Sulayman Abu al Ghaith, a former al Qaeda spokesman who is now serving a life sentence in the US, can be heard over footage of combat from JNIM. \u201cGod ordered us to protect the vulnerable, so we protect the vulnerable. God ordered us to terrorize the apostates, so we terrorize the apostates. God ordered us to kill the leaders of disbelief, so we kill the leaders of disbelief,\u201d al Ghaith said as he linked al Qaeda\u2019s jihad to \u201cprotecting the vulnerable\u201d around the world.\nThe message then shifted to lambasting both Mali and France for their efforts to combat the jihadist group in the West African country. JNIM used English-speaking political commentators to suggest France\u2019s involvement in Mali is a large conspiracy as part of a wider war against Islam. A JNIM official identified as Abdul Hakim al Muhajir [implying he is a foreign fighter] reiterated in this point in a long-winded tirade against France.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s war on Muslims in the region is not a economic war \u2026 it is between faith and apostasy, and Islam and idolatry,\u201d al Muhajir stated in his speech. That theme was common for JNIM and its predecessor groups in Mali, as it painted France as an occupying force oppressing Muslims in a war against Islam.

This was immediately before showing suicide bombers and an assault team training for the April 14 suicide assault on the joint UN-French base in Timbuktu. One actual UN peacekeeper was killed in that attack, while at least 10 others were wounded during the assault. France confirmed seven of its soldiers were also wounded. Additionally, the French military reported at least 15 jihadists were killed.\nDespite a French counter-terrorism operation, UN troops, and troops from the G5 Sahel, JNIM remain a potent threat within Mali. Its violence has also been continuously shifting further south within Mali, as well as pouring into neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso and Niger.", "orig_sample_length": 1060, "prompt_length": 860, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "pe.\nIn contrast to the jihadist message, the French military has made no secret of its mission to combat JNIM and its predecessor groups in Mali and the Sahel region.

The global jihadist movement is one in which the conflicts in one part of the world is seen as being tied to the same conflict in another part of the world.

NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world and over the last five years URMC has received approximately $789 million in research funding from the organization.\nCollins traveled to Rochester to deliver a positive message: it is an extremely exciting time for biomedical research. In a keynote address to faculty members, staff, students, trainees and alumni, he detailed several new NIH initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot and the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. He highlighted the work of David C. Linehan, M.D., director of clinical operations at UR Medicine\u2019s Wilmot Cancer Institute and Chair of Surgery at URMC who is studying new immune therapies for pancreatic cancer, as well as Thomas O\u2019Connor, Ph.D., professor of Psychiatry and director of the Wynne Center for Family Research at URMC who is among a group of scientists studying prenatal inflammation and child health as part of ECHO.\n\u201cWe are in a time of such amazing diversity of opportunity, with people working in fields that maybe weren\u2019t even invented 20 years ago, making advances in basic, translational and clinical science and everything in between,\u201d said Collins, a physician-geneticist noted for his landmark discoveries of disease genes and his leadership of the international Human Genome Project.\nTurning scientific discoveries into new treatments for patients is priority for the NIH and Collins applauded URMC on its new $19 million grant to continue the \u201cbench-to-bedside\u201d research taking place at the University\u2019s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Collins cited translational research conducted by cardiologist Arthur J. Moss, M.D., which has led to new treatments for patients with Long QT syndrome (LQTS), and infectious disease expert John J. Treanor, M.D., which is helping scientists in pursuit of a universal flu vaccine.\nAfter many lean years, Collins reported that the NIH budget is increasing and outlined several new funding initiatives, such as the NIH Director\u2019s Early", "baseline_completion": "Independence Award, which is helping Elaine L. Hill, Ph.D.,assistant professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences study the impact of fracking on infant and child health.\nCollins\u2019 trip to the Medical Center included an intimate discussion with graduate students and junior researchers about the importance of communicating science to the public and policymakers, increasing diversity in biomedical research and mechanisms to support young scientists at the start of their careers. Members of the Center for RNA Biology highlighted their most promising work for Collins and Center director Lynne E. Maquat, Ph.D. gave Collins a tour of her lab, where he met more trainees and junior researchers (admittedly, Collins\u2019 favorite part of visits like these).\nCongresswoman Louise M.

In contrast, the scenic route is by car, a journey time around the winding roads, of about 20 minutes.\nThe island, which is joined to the mainland by a stone bridge, part of famine relief work in the mid-19th century, is one of many in an archipelago that includes the better-known isles of Sherkin and Hare.\nOne of its owners, Pat McKnight, then Denniff, hence the name, bought it in 1974 when west Cork was beginning to flourish as an alternative location. Her parents had had a place in the cove in Baltimore since the 1950s. After a drink with estate agent Charles McCarthy in the Algiers Inn in Baltimore, her husband Tim McKnight recalls that locals couldn\u2019t believe that she paid IR\u00a314,500 for a farmhouse on a sprawling parcel of about 16 acres looking out across the estuary of the Ilen river to the islands of Sherkin and, on a clear day, Cape Clear.\nThe property, which dates back to the mid-19th century, is charming in every way. The back door, the one in daily use by its owners, is an old half-door and leads straight into the living room, one of the rooms in the original part of the house.\nHere the beamed ceiling height is low, about 7.5ft. It has an inglenook fireplace set into a bare stone wall, where a wood-burning stove has been installed. Underfoot is a slate floor which was damp-proofed in 2010 as part of extensive works carried out by the owners.\nThe works included re", "baseline_completion": "building the kitchen and interconnecting dining room, a gorgeous space with windows on three sides and leading out to a south-facing patio.\nUpstairs there are four bedrooms, accessed via a waxed timber balustrade staircase leading up from the sitting room.\nThe main house extends to about 185sq m/2,000sq ft, and is seeking \u20ac830,000 through Charles McCarthy. The lands extend down to the sea where there is a small pontoon and mooring, includes several outhouses, one a potter\u2019s studio which, subject to planning, could become a smart self-contained holiday rental.

Other recent work has been to redo the gutters and a new roof.\nAt the time of its purchase, the property was little more than a derelict shell. Much of the lower part of the house had been rebuilt and then unsurprisingly the walls began to sink. The original back door and the front door were ajar and a young couple who saw it from the boat one day, decided to take a look. The McKnights, who now live in England, bought it purely on impulse.\nThe house has two bedrooms, one en suite. The bathroom is small but has a bath and shower. A loft above the bedroom is a large storage area and from here there are views of Sherkin and Roaring Water Bay.\nThe house is set", "w_wm_output": "doing the entire interior, including the replacement of the floorboards, which the current owners, who have run it as a B&B, as well as a self-catering property, have done on several occasions over the past 40 years.\nFrom the living room, the original cottage extends to a large kitchen with a modern, solid timber, wood-burning stove, and a separate dining room. These two rooms were once a single kitchen and then part of a modern extension.

{"idx": 253, "truncated_input": "Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, entered a lobby elevator at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York on Saturday.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said he would deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants when he takes office, but he also appeared to soften some of his campaign pledges and took a major step toward the GOP establishment by naming Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus as his future chief of staff.\nIn Trump\u2019s first television interview since Election Day, the billionaire businessman told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he will deport or incarcerate \u201cthe people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\u2019\u2019 but at the same time he appeared to leave open the possibility that other undocumented immigrants would be allowed to stay in the United States.\n\u201cAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about who are terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are going to make a determination at that,\u201d Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday night.\nBy choosing Priebus as his chief of staff, Trump went with a mainstream, traditional choice, preferred by Washington insiders.\nA Wisconsin native, Priebus, 44, is known to have close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who would be a key ally in getting Trump\u2019s agenda through Congress. Priebus remained largely loyal to Trump during his unorthodox campaign, although he sometimes struggled to defend the nominee\u2019s many statements about treatment of women and minorities.\nA Globe analysis of the state\u2019s election results showed a reddening of the state\u2019s western counties.\nPriebus, supporters suggest, is a Republican Party loyalist who will bring D.C. experience and political acumen to a White House lacking both. He was chosen over a much more controversial, and less-well known, candidate: Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News and the chief strategist of the Trump campaign. Bannon has a history of using his prominence to support anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and racist messages, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog group.\nIn the Trump administration, Bannon will serve as a chief strategist and senior counselor to the president.\n\u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,\u201d Trump said in the announcement.\nThe developments come at an extraordinarily divisive period in American politics.\nPresident-elect Trump with Reince Priebus on election night. Priebus will serve as chief of staff in Trump\u2019s White House.\nIn urban centers, protesters are speaking out against the presidential election, decrying the bombastic \u2014 and sometimes offensive \u2014 rhetoric that Trump used during the election season. Republicans, though giddy at the prospect of a conservative White House, Congress, and Supreme Court, are also unclear on just how much of Trump\u2019s lofty campaign promises he will attempt to fulfill.\nIndeed, in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump signaled that part of his promised wall at the Mexico border \u2014 a signature pledge during his campaign \u2014 might actually be a fence.\nElsewhere on Sunday, Republican leaders also seemed to back away from some of Trump\u2019s policy promises, including jailing Clinton, building the border wall, and implementing a deportation force.\nSpeaking on Fox News, the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said he does not expect Congress to push any further investigations of Clinton, despite the often-repeated rallying cry of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at Trump\u2019s rallies. McCarthy also expressed skepticism at the idea of mass deportations.\n\u2018\u2018First thing you have to do is secure the border and then we\u2019ll have discussions,\u201d McCarthy said.\nRyan, the House speaker who has rallied behind Trump after months of carefully putting distance between himself and the nominee, was more direct than McCarthy.\n\u201cI think we should put people\u2019s minds at ease. That is not what our focus is,\u201d said Ryan, of Wisconsin.\nRyan\u2019s words and the seemingly moderated tone of the president-elect might not calm the fears of Democrats, protesters nationwide, and historically marginalized communities, many of which felt demonized throughout the Trump campaign.\nSome left-leaning activists have reacted to Trump\u2019s election by rushing to social media to claim Trump is #NotMyPresident, despite the looming truth of Inauguration Day. Others, such as US Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, accepted the election results but pledged to hold Trump accountable for the divisive rhetoric he at times deployed.\nThis sentiment, coupled with a recent flare of incidents in which self-described Trump voters were harassing people of different cultures, has received a mixed reaction from Trump\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 and the president-elect himself.\nTrump has made clear that he intends to use Twitter to get his message out, and he continued to snipe at the media over the weekend.\nStephen Bannon, whom Donald Trump named his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist, at Trump Tower Saturday.\n\u201cWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \u2018Trump phenomena,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet posted at 3 a.m. Sunday.\nIn the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump explained that he uses Twitter to \u201cget the word out\u2019\u2019 and go around traditional media outlets.\n\u201cWhen you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI have a method of fighting back.\u201d He vowed to be \u201cvery restrained\u201d in his Twitter posts.\nOn the Sunday morning political talk shows, Trump\u2019s surrogates and advisers downplayed the nationwide anger that continued to surface since his surprising win. Instead, each attempted to recast Trump as a political unifier, a humbled leader capable of compromise and willing to govern for all Americans.\nThere is one area in", "baseline_completion": "which Democrats and Republicans agree: the need for Trump to sign a robust law investing in the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, mentioned public works projects on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, and on CBS News, Senator Bernie Sanders highlighted infrastructure as one area of possible common ground.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see the details. But, in general, rebuilding our infrastructure is absolutely imperative for this country,\u201d said Sanders, an independent of Vermont.\nSanders cautioned Trump against claiming any electoral mandate from Tuesday\u2019s results, since Clinton received more votes nationally than Trump.\n\u201cWe are the majority,\u201d Sanders said.\nAstead W.

The next Supreme Court justice could have a lasting influence on the social issues on which Trump\u2019s campaign was built, including abortion, gun rights, and the death penalty.\nTrump\u2019s advisers have said he will announce his pick early. He also could make the selection on the courthouse steps of the federal courthouse in the city where he was born, Queens, N.Y.", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 171, "spike_entropies": [0.36772239208221436, 0.6872690320014954, 0.7011369466781616, 0.3629925847053528, 0.3519171476364136, 0.8561533093452454, 0.787173330783844, 0.39538952708244324, 0.9670401811599731, 0.8802487850189209, 0.9549639225006104, 0.6309458017349243, 0.8631523251533508, 0.5553508996963501, 0.7986537218093872, 0.6881743669509888, 0.8404827117919922, 0.4245116114616394, 0.35154852271080017, 0.35256123542785645, 0.3523505628108978, 0.4535338580608368, 0.4962618350982666, 0.40777426958084106, 0.49233341217041016, 0.7825442552566528, 0.5654692053794861, 0.8062745332717896, 0.9279922842979431, 0.7717944979667664, 0.4233492314815521, 0.8849101066589355, 0.753617525100708, 0.7872328758239746, 0.4947105348110199, 0.6174381375312805, 0.38579848408699036, 0.35394129157066345, 0.5275830030441284, 0.3585960268974304, 0.3521730601787567, 0.641319751739502, 0.8263049125671387, 0.934607982635498, 0.4269603490829468, 0.7031723856925964, 0.3728152811527252, 0.6730762720108032, 0.35156092047691345, 0.6292816996574402, 0.8341561555862427, 0.4732498228549957, 0.4293942451477051, 0.6028168201446533, 0.673348069190979, 0.6133393049240112, 0.3526734709739685, 0.42657631635665894, 0.6664032340049744, 0.35150596499443054, 0.38709935545921326, 0.5111201405525208, 0.8316171765327454, 0.35181570053100586, 0.8663599491119385, 0.35166215896606445, 0.9620537757873535, 0.7118574976921082, 0.9362061023712158, 0.8762311935424805, 0.8031169176101685, 0.7964146137237549, 0.8893081545829773, 0.6248100399971008, 0.6047390103340149, 0.3606990575790405, 0.6357201337814331, 0.7467528581619263, 0.550948977470398, 0.7798298001289368, 0.35167378187179565, 0.7514232397079468, 0.3547380864620209, 0.4510728716850281, 0.569929838180542, 0.8537759780883789, 0.8755620121955872, 0.7856674194335938, 0.3517948091030121, 0.5553836822509766, 0.6735622882843018, 0.9180347323417664, 0.6306063532829285, 0.8591446876525879, 0.3518218994140625, 0.571264386177063, 0.43715742230415344, 0.8271103501319885, 0.8714810013771057, 0.7176033854484558, 0.7510968446731567, 0.3956131041049957, 0.5215287804603577, 0.7708125710487366, 0.35167837142944336, 0.7270338535308838, 0.729104220867157, 0.731975793838501, 0.6489251255989075, 0.6559452414512634, 0.6326025724411011, 0.3516462445259094, 0.6342534422874451, 0.8242615461349487, 0.546625554561615, 0.35543566942214966, 0.6406825184822083, 0.8275635838508606, 0.8957980275154114, 0.3527992069721222, 0.389433354139328, 0.5168731212615967, 0.8725968599319458, 0.3518272936344147, 0.8710530996322632, 0.35169717669487, 0.9520372152328491, 0.3802943229675293, 0.8554500937461853, 0.8901509046554565, 0.7257822751998901, 0.792638897895813, 0.9352096319198608, 0.35164692997932434, 0.4983340799808502, 0.794935941696167, 0.884600043296814, 0.6003683805465698, 0.8214871883392334, 0.84293532371521, 0.8757745027542114, 0.9483113288879395, 0.8421497941017151, 0.8179811239242554, 0.9205028414726257, 0.8904114961624146, 0.8771587610244751, 0.3554954528808594, 0.3518178462982178, 0.40158897638320923, 0.7426396012306213, 0.4769226610660553, 0.8390974998474121, 0.6252237558364868, 0.35151904821395874, 0.35200929641723633, 0.39636602997779846, 0.7686078548431396, 0.922321617603302, 0.6668548583984375, 0.6034982800483704, 0.9016803503036499, 0.6946564316749573, 0.6660639643669128, 0.7139390707015991, 0.5345750451087952, 0.8415765762329102, 0.35282906889915466, 0.35207241773605347, 0.49495524168014526, 0.5574964284896851]}

{"idx": 255, "truncated_input": "What are neutrophils and what do they do?\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps heal damaged tissues and resolve infections. Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions.\nNeutrophils help prevent infections by blocking, disabling, digesting, or warding off invading particles and microorganisms. They also communicate with other cells to help them repair cells and mount a proper immune response.\nThe body produces neutrophils in the bone marrow, and they account for 55\u201370 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream. A normal overall white blood cell level in the bloodstream for an adult is somewhere between 4,500 and 11,000 per millimeters cubed (mm3).\nWhen there is an infection or another source of inflammation in the body, special chemicals alert mature neutrophils, which then leave the bone marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the site in need.\nUnlike some other cells or blood components, neutrophils can travel through junctions in the cells that line blood vessel walls and enter into tissues directly.\nIn this article, we look at the reasons for high or low neutrophil levels, how doctors can test these levels, and what normal neutrophil levels are for different groups.\nThere are many different reasons why a person may have higher or lower than normal levels of neutrophils in their blood.\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell.\nHaving an abnormally high level of neutrophils in the blood is known as neutrophilic leukocytosis, also known as neutrophilia.\nSome inflammatory conditions can increase neutrophil levels, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, and vasculitis.\nAn abnormally low blood level of neutrophils is a condition called neutropenia.\nA drop in neutrophil blood levels typically occurs when the body uses immune cells faster than it produces them or the bone marrow is not producing them correctly.\nAn enlarged spleen may also cause a decrease in neutrophil levels because the spleen traps and destroys neutrophils and other blood cells.\nA laboratory specialist can evaluate a blood sample for white blood cell levels.\nDoctors can identify changes in neutrophil levels from a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, which identifies specific groups of white blood cells.\nA doctor may order a CBC test when someone is experiencing a range of symptoms related to infection, chronic illness, and injury, such as fever, pain, and exhaustion. A nurse or technician will draw a small amount of blood from the arm and send it off for evaluation.\nIf the initial test shows a higher or lower number of white blood cells than normal, the doctor will likely repeat the test to confirm the results. If the initial results are confirmed, a doctor will perform a physical exam, ask questions about the person's lifestyle, and review their medical history.\nIf there is no apparent reason for changes in white blood cell levels, the doctor will order a more specific test. Laboratory specialists will look for specific white blood cells, such as immature neutrophils called myeloblasts. During an infection or chronic illness, these cells emerge from the bone marrow and mature in the blood instead of the bone marrow.\nIf myeloblasts or other white blood cells appear in significant levels in the blood, the doctor will request a bone marrow sample.\nBone marrow collection involves inserting a long needle into part of the pelvis near the back of your hip. The procedure can be very painful, and a doctor will typically take the sample in a hospital setting with at least a local anesthetic.\nExperts will examine the bone marrow sample to see if neutrophils and other blood cells are developing correctly and are in regular supply.\nLeukopenia is a condition where a person has a reduced white blood cell levels in their bloodstream. Learn about the causes, symptoms, and treatments here.\nChanges in neutrophil levels are often a sign of more significant changes in white blood cell levels.\nIn non-pregnant adults, a white blood cell blood count over 11,000 per mm3 is known as leukocytosis, which is an elevated white blood cell count. Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs when a person has over 7,000 per mm3 mature neutrophils in their bloodstream.\nMinor changes in neutrophil or white blood cell levels are typically nothing to worry about as long as they are temporary. A raised white blood cell count often means the body is responding to infection, injury, or stress.\nSome people have naturally lower levels of white blood cells and neutrophils than other people due to a range of factors, including congenital conditions.\nIf neutrophil or white blood cell levels are significantly altered for no apparent reason or remain raised or lowered, a doctor will order more tests to determine the cause.\nSeverely high or low levels of white blood cells often require emergency care and monitoring. People with severe neutropenia will have an inadequate defense against infection.\nPeople with severe neutrophilia typically have a life-threatening type of infection or other inflammatory illness that requires treatment, such as cancer.\nNutritional yeast is a plant-based source of vitamin B-12.\nThe best way to correct abnormal neutrophil levels is to address and treat the underlying cause.\nAntibiotics can treat bacterial infections, while antifungal medicine treats fungal infections. People can treat certain viral infections with medications that slow viral activity. Otherwise, supportive therapies, such as fluids and rest, may be part of the treatment plan.\nPeople with altered neutrophil levels caused by medications or procedures may need to stop or adjust treatments.\nPeople with severely low levels of neutrophils often require monitoring, antibiotic therapy, and hospitalization to reduce the risk of severe infection.\nThis period of intensive care helps keep people with weakened immune systems away from potentially harmful microorganisms. It also supports the body, giving it time to produce more white blood cells.\nTry not to over-exercise or exercise beyond comfort levels.\nReduce stress levels and treat chronic or severe stress.\nSeek medical attention for signs of infection, such as fever, weakness, fatigue, or pain, and treat infections exactly as prescribed.\nFollow a healthful, balanced diet.\nTreat chronic conditions, such as genetic or inflammatory conditions, exactly as prescribed.\nHowever, people with only minor or mild changes in their neutrophil blood levels often show no sympt", "baseline_completion": "oms and do not require any treatment.\nHaving a healthy number of neutrophils in the blood and bone marrow is crucial to the correct working of the immune system.\nWhen neutrophil levels are higher or lower than usual for more than a short period, a doctor will order several tests to work out the underlying cause. People with significantly altered neutrophil levels may also require hospitalization to prevent infection and treat life-threatening conditions.\nIt is a good idea to have regular wellness checks at a doctor's office to stay on top of health. Anyone with concerns about their neutrophil count or any medical condition should talk to their doctor who will be able to answer questions they may have.\nHuizen, Jennifer. \"What are neutrophils and what do they do?.\" Medical News Today.

With digital tools, they can stay socially engaged \u2014 and reach out for help, if they need it.\nEvery morning, after his second cup of coffee, he answers emails about the war and his organization. Then he does research, which helps him stay abreast of any newly published academic studies. He also uses his PC to plan upcoming seminars \u2014 honoring the centennial of America\u2019s engagement in the war \u2014 seeking conference venues, speakers and nearby hotels.\nHe searches the web to find images for his World War I lectures to civic groups and schools, and then puts his presentation on a thumb drive for travel.\nHam radio operator Rudy Bahr, 93, of Mountain View uses a computer program that, in an earthquake or other crisis, can communicate radio messages directly to emergency operation centers, hospitals and other critical facilities. Created by the volunteer-run Southern Peninsula Emergency Communications System, it offers a direct connection that is more reliable than traditional email or cell services.\nSaratoga\u2019s Tsing Bardin, 78, and her husband, 85, use FaceTime with their children and grandchildren in Italy and in New York. \u201cIt is free and you can see them as you speak,\u201d she said.\nGoogle Calendar is the tool used by 91-year-old Lois Hall, of Palo Alto, to book appointments for one-on-one tech tutoring of other elders at a Computer Learning Center, sponsored by Palo Alto\u2019s senior center Avenidas.

She also uses email to plan monthly dinners with friends.\nShe uses Netflix to watch new episodes of the Canadian drama \u201cHeartland.\u201d With the holidays approaching, she\u2019ll use it for shopping.\nSims didn\u2019t expect to find much of a correlation between technology and well-being in adults older than 80 because these elders were considered to be the most unfamiliar with these technologies and the least likely to use them.\nConventional wisdom holds that as people age, they perceive time as more limited \u2014 and prioritize meaningful interactions with their loved ones rather than learning new information or meeting new people.\n\u201cI was going into it a little bit skeptical,\u201d according to Sims, whose research is published in the current issue of the Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences. She conducted the study with Andrew Reed, a former Stanford postdoctoral fellow, and Dawn Carr, an assistant professor of sociology at Florida State University.\nThe research team surveyed 445 people between the ages of 80 and 93, online and over the phone.

{"idx": 261, "truncated_input": "Apple's new Music Memos app captures musical inspiration, while GarageBand adds a new AI drummer and loop arranger.\nWhen a bolt of musical inspiration hits, many musicians will reach for their smart phones, pop open the built-in voice-recorder app, and make a quick recording of some combination of guitar, voice or piano, hoping to capture the essence of the idea before it fades.\nBut a voice memo is a blunt tool for capturing a song idea, and the artist is left on their own to figure out how to translate a rough recording into something more substantial -- or even to remember what chords were played.\nPress this big button to record.\nEnter Music Memos, a new iOS app from Apple. This simple app is a new type of voice-memo recorder, built around capturing musical ideas, giving them a slight polish, and sending the best ones on to a more powerful music tool, such as Apple's own GarageBand or Logic Pro. It's completely free, and should be available on the App Store later today.\nMusic Memos starts with a simple record button in the middle of the screen. Tap it and the app starts recording -- it's optimized for guitar or piano, but you could really record anything: voice, ukulele, klezmer, whatever, although other instruments may miss out on some of the advanced features.\nTrim and loop the recording and edit the chord information here.\nIt's what happens next that makes Music Memos stand out from a standard memo-recording app. If you recorded some acoustic guitar or piano, Music Memos analyses the audio input and attempts to chop your song demo into bars, in the appropriate time signature, and then adds chord labels.\nYou can tweak the recording a good deal, trimming the start and end to form a loop, and overwriting the chord information with your own notations. In practice, I found it worked best with strummy, coffee-shop open chords in 4/4 time. Trying to get a little more complex, such as throwing in jazzy major-7th chords, forced me to manually enter the appropriate chords for each bar.\nSongs can be exported to GarageBand or shared via services including SoundCloud and email.\nBut once that's all set, you can turn on the surprisingly satisfying auto-accompaniment tools, and a simple bass line and drum track will follow along with the rhythm and chords, like a bare-bones backing band. It offers just a few basic beats, and again seems targeted at the strummy, coffee-shop singer-songwriter crowd, but it's also very satisfying to hear a fleshed-out version of a song idea almost instantly.\nSong ideas can also be labeled with tags, and you can add comments or even song lyrics to a notes section for each recording. Music Memo recordings can be synced to iCloud, or you can export the actual files to GarageBand or Logic Pro in order to work on them further in a more full-featured music app.\nThe next step up from Music Memos is GarageBand, Apple's consumer-friendly music recording and editing program. Included on most iOS and OS X devices, it takes an iMovie-like approach to recording, throwing out some of the traditional user interfaces found in programs such as ProTools or Apple's own Logic Pro (which were, in turn, copied from actual real-world recording studios), and instead creating a new, hopefully more intuitive, way to record music.\nHaving used old-school music DAWs (shorthand for \"digital audio workstations,\" a term used to describe computer-based recording programs) such as ProTools and Logic extensively over the years, I've always found the GarageBand approach hard to wrap my head around. But, this new 2.1 update adds some interesting new features that make it easier than ever to get started crafting or arranging music, even if you have little or no experience.\nThe Live Loops interface in GarageBand.\nThe most notable is an entirely new (and entirely optional) interface called Live Loops. It's a performance-friendly sequencer for arranging samples and loops, which can be lined up to play in order, or simply triggered on the fly by tapping on the appropriate square-shaped loop. Apple includes several preloaded templates in different music genres, or you can start with a blank field and import various loops and samples, or original recordings made in GarageBand. With the right tempo and note information (routinely included with commercial samples and loops) the Live Loops interface keeps all the parts in sync and flowing together naturally.\nThe idea reminds me of performance-friendly music programs such as Ableton Live, but this version is much more pick-up-and-play, and my four-year-old was having a great time with it, triggering samples and creating on-the-fly arrangements in under a minute. Live Loops is fun to play with, but probably more useful for live improvisation from the DJ booth or creating EDM arrangements than traditional songwriting and recording.\nOutside of Live Loops, there's also the standard music recording and editing tools in GarageBand, augmented by some new automation features and EQ tools for tweaking the overall sound.\nYou can still record audio via an external mic or your device's built-in mic (although the latter is not really recommended) or play virtual guitars and keyboards on-screen, which is fun but involves a lot of trial and error to get a feel for. \"Smart\" versions of these instruments will play preset patterns based on chord information you provide. That can give you an instant backing band for ideas, but again, there's a robotic sameness to the performances and the styles are on the dry side, so it's not going to replace calling your musically talented friends up and asking them to play on your album.\nNew for GarageBand 2.1 is the addition of Drummer, a high-concept AI drum tool previously found only in the $200 Logic Pro software. Drummer starts with several fictional drummer profiles, each with his or her own music genres and drum kits, and builds a drum track for your song that can", "baseline_completion": "be adjusted on the fly to be louder, softer, more or less complex, using different cymbal or kick/snare variations, and with more or fewer fills. The end result is pretty good, and much more human-feeling than basic drum loops or samples. Although, again, the genre choices tend to run towards EDM, straightforward rock, and commercial-sounding hip-hop/R&B. I'm still waiting for a specialized bossa nova drummer, or a virtual version of Bernard Purdie.\nThe Drummer app inside GarageBand.\nMusic Memos is for free for iOS users and will work on iPhone 4s and later, and iPad 2 and later. GarageBand 2.1 for iOS will be included on new iOS devices with 32GB or more of storage, and owners of previous versions can upgrade for free if they have iOS 9.", "orig_sample_length": 1609, "prompt_length": 1409, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "be tweaked in the usual ways. It's a very cool tool, but I've had mixed results with it, and it's not fool-proof.\nFor example, I asked it to build a drum track for a song in the style of the 1970s band Little Feat, and it created a high-energy, guitar-driven song that was more like the Allman Brothers than the down-home, acoustic funk of Little Feat. It's not a complete disaster, but it's not right for that specific song. You can adjust the tempo and add a more subtle feel, but even then the drumming still felt a little heavy-handed and lacking in imagination.\nIt's also good at creating a drum track for a song in an entirely different style, such as a 1970s reggae ballad, and the track is pretty good. But in", "w_wm_output": "be edited or replaced.\nFor instance, the \"Jam Session\" profile is a classic rock kit that goes heavy on the snare and cymbals. You can create a more minimalist rock track by replacing the drummer with a simple electronic kit. Or, if you're the experimental type, you can replace the kit altogether with a hand-crafted set of electronic drums.\nIt's a neat trick and one that works better than I expected, although the tracks still have a somewhat mechanical, computer-generated feeling to them. But, when used carefully, it's a handy tool to add a more human-like feel to your music.\nIf you've ever recorded a song and then started to feel like the lyrics don't quite fit the music (or vice-versa), GarageBand makes it easy to replace any section of a song with a completely different track.

{"idx": 264, "truncated_input": "President Barack Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office last Thursday, after the two met to discuss the presidential transition.\nDonald Trump's victory in the race for the White House leaves widespread uncertainty about what's in store for public schools under the first Republican administration in eight years. Aside from school choice, Trump, a New York-based real estate developer who has never before held public office, spent little time talking about K-12 education during his campaign. And he has no record to speak of on the issue for insights into what he may propose.\n\"We're all engaging in a lot of speculation because there hasn't been a lot of serious discussion about this, especially in the Trump campaign,\" Martin R. West, an associate professor of education at Harvard University, said in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election. West has advised Republicans, including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, on education.\nTrump did propose a $20 billion plan to dramatically expand school choice for low-income students. It would use federal money to help them attend private, charter, magnet, and regular public schools of their choice. It's also designed to leverage additional state investments in school choice of up to $100 billion nationwide.\nIn the campaign, the president-elect also embraced merit pay for teachers, without offering details beyond saying he found it unfair that \"bad\" teachers sometimes earned \"more than the good ones.\" And, on the early-childhood front, he's pitched offering six weeks of maternity leave to women who do not get it through their employers, expanding the availability of dependent-care savings accounts, and offering tax incentives for employers to provide on-site day care.\nBut otherwise, the Trump campaign mostly dealt in sound bites with such controversial issues as the Common Core State Standards, the possibility of getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, and gun-free school zones.\n\"I could really see him trying to minimize any role [of the federal government in education],\" Nat Malkus, a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in contemplating the implications of a Trump presidency ahead of the vote.\nWhile education is not a high-profile issue politically at the moment, it's not as if the Trump administration won't have anything to do on school policy.\nAt or near the top of the K-12 to-do list is how the new administration handles the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, the latest version of the flagship federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act that was first passed in 1965. The Education Department under President Barack Obama is relatively close to finalizing ESSA regulations governing how states hold schools accountable and how districts must show they are using federal money to supplement their state and local school budgets.\nRepublicans in Congress have been critical of both sets of proposals from the department, particularly the one governing the supplemental-money rule. In fact, 25 GOP lawmakers recently asked the department to rescind its proposal for ensuring federal funds are supplemental, not a replacement for state and local money, on the grounds that the proposal would give the department too much power over state and local budget decisions.\nThe incoming administration may be on the same page as those lawmakers, said Gerard Robinson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former state schools chief in Virginia and Florida.\n\"I think [Trump's] secretary of education will handle it differently than what we've seen from [current Secretary] John King,\" regarding the so-called supplement-not-supplant rules, Robinson said. Robinson is serving as a member of the Trump transition team, but spoke only on his own behalf.\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton focused more on early education and college affordability than K-12 in her losing bid for the White House.\nHowever, when it comes to ESSA in general, Robinson said he believes that Trump views the law as a result of a \"bipartisan coalition\" and that the president-elect won't get too heavily involved in ESSA's rollout.\nAnd Robinson expects states to have a great deal of flexibility in the ESSA accountability plans that they submit to the Trump administration starting next year\u2014significantly more than they enjoyed under Obama-era waivers from the No Child Left Behind Act, the predecessor to ESSA.\n\"This is a great time to be a state chief,\" Robinson said, adding at the same time that \"I don't want state chiefs to think that when they turn those [plans] in that, 'Oh, well, these will just get approved.' \"\nWhat's more, a lot of policies under the No Child Left Behind Act were part of the law but the George W. Bush or Obama administration didn't do much to enforce them. A couple of examples: the requirement that highly qualified teachers be distributed fairly between poor and less-poor schools, and that districts offer free tutoring to students in schools that weren't making progress under the law.\nThere could be similar examples of provisions that are on the books in ESSA, or in the Obama administration's regulations for the law, said Vic Klatt, a one-time aide to House Republicans who is now a principal at the Penn Hill Group. And since the Trump administration will be the first to enforce ESSA, it could be \"easier and less disruptive\" for it to simply ignore parts of the law than it would be for another administration down the line, Klatt said.\nTrump could also discard another key piece of the Obama education legacy: The president-elect could significantly curb the role of the department's office for civil rights when it comes to state and local policies, according to Robinson, and thereby return the OCR's role more to how it operated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. That could have a big impact on everything from action on racial disparities in school discipline to transgender students' rights.\nRobinson also said that he expects the OCR to ensure that students' rights are not \"trampled on.\"\nSome civil rights advocates though, are already concerned, given some of Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric on Muslims and Latinos, that the office won't flex its enforcement muscles.\n\"We're worried,\" said Liz King, the director of education policy for the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"We're hearing what everyone else is hearing from teachers and families that kids don't feel safe.\"\nMuch depends on whom Trump picks to lead his Education Department\u2014assuming that he decides not to seek elimination or drastic cutbacks to the agency, which he has sometimes said he would like to do.\nIn October, Carl Palladino, a school board member in Buffalo, N.Y., and a Trump campaign surrogate, said he believed that if elected, Trump would pick someone from outside the education policy world to lead the department.\nAnother critical decision will be on who reviews states' proposed accountability plans for ESSA next year.\n\"Who are going to be his people? If he brings in a traditional right-of-center group, you can take it from there,\" said Maria Ferguson, the executive director of the Center on Education Policy, who worked in the Education Department under President Bill Clinton.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks at his victory rally on Nov. 9 in New York City. The Republican real estate developer made school choice a key theme when talking about public education on the campaign trail.\nFerguson suggested a traditional conservative policy agenda of expanded charter schools and other initiatives would probably get traction under Trump.\n\"All these familiar themes that the right-of-center groups have talked about will become a version of his agenda,\" Ferguson predicted. She mentioned school choice and groups like the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination. \"But I don't think it's going to come from him.\"\nEarlier this year, Trump tapped Rob Goad, a staffer for Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., to be his education adviser, not long before the Trump campaign released its $20 billion school choice plan. There are some basic similarities between Trump's plan and a push last year to make federal Title I aid \"portable\" for disadvantaged students to use at both public and private schools.\nAnd Trump's transition team for education includes Robinson, the former Florida and Virginia state chief, and Williamson M. Evers, a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, who worked at the Education Department under President George W. Bush.\nMuch also depends on Trump's relationship with Congress and to what extent he empowers key GOP lawmakers on education policy.\nBesides ESSA, Congress has been fairly active in moving education-related legislation. In recent months, for example, the House of Representatives approved reauthorizations of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.\nSome, but less, progress has also been made on renewing the Child Nutrition Act. And the Higher Education Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Head Start federal preschool program are up for reauthorization in the near future.\nTrump has outlined a general plan on college affordability, including capping student-loan repayments at 12.", "baseline_completion": "5 percent of income and instituting loan forgiveness after 15 years for certain borrowers. College affordability is a more prominent issue thanks to the 2016 presidential campaign. And since Congress remains sharply divided along partisan lines, Trump and the Republicans likely won't be able to simply roll ahead with all their preferences on higher education.\n\"You're not doing anything legislatively without bipartisan support,\" said West, of Harvard. \"It's not obvious to me that there is a clear Republican agenda in Congress right now with respect to K-12 education, except for trying to ensure that ESSA is implemented in a way consistent with the intent of the law of empowering states to design accountability systems as they see fit.\"\nBut uncertainty prevails, both over what the new president will take an interest in and how much he will push to get education bills and initiatives over the finish line.", "orig_sample_length": 2383, "prompt_length": 2183, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "5 percent of discretionary income. He's also proposed creating a \"21st century skills-based\" workforce initiative, and increasing Pell Grants and private-loan forgiveness for students who go into public service.\nBut Trump has not spelled out a plan for how he would handle any of the major federal education laws.\n\"He's not a big government guy,\" said Mark P. McQuillen, the president of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, whose members include career colleges and technical schools. \"I think he's going to want to find ways to reduce spending.

{"idx": 267, "truncated_input": "By the time Ohio State\u2019s slow-arriving student section filled up, the Buckeyes had already taken a 7-0 lead against UNLV as speedy H-back Parris Campbell raced 69 yards for the opening touchdown on the offense\u2019s second play. The Scarlet and Gray extended the early lead, continued to build upon it and never allowed the Rebels to even feign a threat as Ohio State dominated, winning 54-21 Saturday afternoon at Ohio Stadium.\nRedshirt senior quarterback J.T. Barrett marched his team down the field at will against an overmatched, less-talented UNLV defense, completing 12-of-17 passes for 209 yards and five touchdowns and subbed out before halftime.\nSeven players \u2014 wideouts Terry McLaurin, Johnnie Dixon, K.J. Hill, Binjimen Victor, Campbell and walk-on C.J. Saunders and tight end Rashod Berry \u2014 caught touchdowns for the Buckeyes, the most in a single game in Ohio State history.\nBarrett overthrew sophomore wideout K.J Hill on one of his first passes of the game, but settled in as the Buckeyes scored on all but one of his drives. Campbell led Ohio State with three catches for 105 yards, but fumbled near the goal line on his team\u2019s third drive of the game.\nThe Rebels offense stood no chance facing off against the Buckeyes\u2019 stout defense. An aggressive, blitz-heavy defensive front pressured redshirt freshman quarterback Armani Rogers the entire game. Late in the first quarter, backed up at the 2-yard line, defensive tackle Dre\u2019Mont Jones stuffed a run and forced Ohio State\u2019s first safety of the season.\nThe Buckeyes racked up four sacks and a season-high 13 tackles for loss. Sophomore defensive end Nick Bosa led the Buckeyes with three tackles behind the line of scrimmage.\nRogers competed 11-of-19 passes for 88 yards. The Rebels, buoyed by junior running back Lexington Thomas\u2019 55-yard touchdown, rushed for 41 yards on 176 carries.\nWith 3:32 left in the second quarter while leading 37-7, redshirt freshman quarterback Dwayne Haskins replaced Barrett, and first-team All-American center Billy Price subbed out of the blowout.\nHaskins threaded the needle to Saunders for his first touchdown of the game, a 28-yard strike across the middle. The strong-armed quarterback went 15-for-23 and 228 yards and tossed two touchdowns. He hit Berry late in the third quarter who rumbled for a 38-yard touchdown, the first of the defensive end-turned-tight end\u2019s career.\nHaskins later threw an interception to linebacker/defensive back Javin White, who took it 65 yards for a touchdown, the first pick-six thrown by an Ohio State quarterback this year.\nFreshman", "baseline_completion": "running back J.K.

{"idx": 269, "truncated_input": "DENMARK - UK \u2013 ASIA - EUROPE \u2013 In a bold move designed to out manoeuvre their rivals Maersk, the largest container shipping line in the world, today announced what they consider to be the first major step forward in box transportation for well over a decade. \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 will offer guaranteed delivery times from four Asian ports to three major European hubs for any FCL freight deliveries every day of the week.\nSpeaking at the London launch Eivind Kolding, CEO Maersk Line said that from the company's inception in 1928 very little changed from the monthly schedules offered until in the late 1940\u2019s when twice monthly services appeared. Even with the introduction of containerisation weekly schedules failed to appear until the 1990\u2019s since when little if anything had changed. He said it was Maersk\u2019s intention to offer shippers a \u2018conveyor belt\u2019 service with Maersk becoming a natural extension of a supplier\u2019s production line.\nThe service schedules were arrived at after Maersk embarked on a protracted dialogue with their major customers and indeed the product is principally aimed at the heavy hitters, the regular clients with extensive contract commitments to shipping large quantities, which is not to say that spot purchase clients will not necessarily benefit from the reduced delivery times Maersk feel are attainable.\nThe discussion with stakeholders produced three clear requirements including reliability, all shippers were keen to know exactly when their goods would arrive at the destination port as currently around 50% of TEU\u2019s fail to meet the original estimated times of arrival. Complicated systems were another bugbear, consignors wanted a one stop, one touch system rather than the nineteen or so inputs required to send a box on its way which currently exists. The third request was to ensure that wherever possible the customer could claim to maintain their green credentials by utilising a system that was as clean as could reasonably be expected.\n\u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 is the product of these discussions and Maersk are so confident of its success they are to pay compensation for every container that fails to meet the deadline they have underwritten. The company will pay customers who sign up to the system compensation of $100 for a delay between one and three days. Should the freight arrive 4 days late they will hand over $300. Needless to say Maersk have written in get out clauses for bad weather, port strikes etc.\nOf course there is a downside, at present up to 50% of booked boxes fail to arrive at the port in time to meet the cut off times, or indeed at all, and to the container companies this simply means lost revenue. Containers booked under the new system which fail to arrive will be subject to a penalty which presumably will be negotiated with individual shippers (those which deign to agree to it). Maersk see this system as a way to directly influence the current overbooking problem.\nThe new schedules, from Ningbo, Shanghai, Yantian and Tanjung Pelepas to Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam, will occupy 70 vessels of the company\u2019s fleet, around 25% of Maersk Line\u2019s TEU carrying capacity. Despite the mention of the intent to make the service as green as possible it simply may not be feasible with traffic levels as they are. Only by running the newer, larger yet more efficient vessels closer to their full capacity can reduced emissions of CO2 per tonne be achieved. To ensure vessels make their guaranteed time targets it may even be sometimes necessary to abandon the current slow steaming policy, designed to conserve expensive fuel and reduce pollution levels, simply to stick to schedules.\n\u201cThis is the first time compensation will be paid by a shipping company and this is to underscore our confidence in this product. We have been in discussion with a number of customers, including Sony, and they have expressed approval. \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 responds to some key concerns by ensuring on time delivery in Northern Europe. How can we do this? By upping capacity and spreading port calls and having a back up plan for every vessel. All the customer needs is total transport. We see larger customers with sophisticated management systems taking advantage of this and reducing their warehousing needs.\nNo partnerships with other lines will be involved in the provision of this service and, before anyone believes this will be rolled out globally, even Maersk admit that the daily cut off system is currently only feasible on the busy Asia to Europe run. Cynics will note that Maersk are due to collect a lot more of the bigger container vessels they have on order within the next year or two and they need cargo to fill them but there is no doubt that other box carriers will feel a chill down their spines at what is a very inventive and bold move to completely dominate the Asian European freight trade.\nThe first daily cut off will be on the 24th October, the guaranteed transportation times to the three European ports (Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam) are as follows. Ex Ningbo \u2013 36 days, ex Shanghai \u2013 34 days, ex Yantian \u2013 30 days and for Tanjung Pe", "baseline_completion": "lepas \u2013 26 days. Transportation time is defined as from the cut off date issued for the departure port and the availability of the cargo at the port of destination. If cargo arrives early there will be no demurrage charges until the agreed cargo availability date has passed.\nAround seven million forty foot equivalent units pass from Asia to Northern Europe annually and Maersk currently shift over one million of them. With this set of schedules it is obvious that the Danish giants intend to take up as much of the market as possible by concentrating more than ever on the companies responsible for the bulk of this traffic. The end result remains to be seen but as this scheme takes shape at least two of Maersk\u2019s main rivals will be looked at very closely by industry analysts should it result in an upswing of tonnage for \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019.\nPhoto:- The giant Emma Maersk in port.", "orig_sample_length": 1388, "prompt_length": 1188, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "lepas \u2013 32 days.\nThe company has been approached by the CAA Media Unit for comment on the issue of Aircraft noise complaints from the residents of Hounslow.\nThe CAA has been asked by the Department for Transport (DfT) to provide it with information about the operation of the UK's airspace and how this has been affected by changes to the flight paths, known as 'RNAV'.\nThe CAA has provided a detailed response which is being reviewed by DfT.\nhttp://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/RNAV%20consultation%20response.pdf - in 2007 the CAA received an average of 50 complaints a week.\nhttp://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/RNAV%20consultation%20response.pdf - the RNA", "w_wm_output": "lepas the deadline is 34 days.", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 12, "spike_entropies": [0.35367128252983093, 0.364736944437027, 0.7282705307006836, 0.9122388362884521, 0.44468075037002563, 0.4474821090698242, 0.42982402443885803, 0.5685722827911377, 0.816855788230896, 0.36550912261009216, 0.4399121403694153, 0.7771543860435486]}

Public Domain/U.S. Govt. photo.\nOn this day in 1948, Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington, the second daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and widow of the heir to the Devonshire dukedom, died in a plane crash en route to secure her father's blessings on her second marriage. She was born on February 20, 1920, and was only 28 at the time of her death.\nWhen President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed JFK's father Joseph Kennedy ambassador to the Court of St. James, his daughter Kathleen spent a year and a half living in London. She was educated in London at Queen's College.\nBeautiful and spirited, she was named the \"most exciting debutante of 1938.\" In 1943 she returned to England to work in a center for servicemen set up by the Red Cross.\nDespite the opposition of her intensely Catholic mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy, known to friends as \"Kick\", married William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, a Protestant and the eldest son and heir of the 10th Duke of Devonshire on May 6, 1944.\nOther than her eldest brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. who died in a plane crash three months after the wedding, no one from the Kennedy family attended the marriage ceremony. Her husband was killed in action only four months later in World War II, and his younger brother Andrew Cavendish, married to Deborah Mitford, became the heir to the dukedom. See the newspaper report of her death on right.\nPopular on the London social circuit and admired by many for her high spirits - though more traditional members of British society found fault with her boisterousness - the dashing young widow eventually became the mistress of Peter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 8th Earl FitzWilliam. The couple planned to wed after Fitzwilliam's planned divorce. Instead, while on a trip to visit Joseph Kennedy Sr. and gain his blessing for their relationship, Lord Fitzwilliam and Lady Hartington died in an airplane crash in Saint-Bauzile, Ard\u00e8che, France.\nOnly her father represented the Kennedy family at her funeral. Her mother, Rose, declined to attend supposedly because of Kathleen's intention to marry outside the Catholic Church a second time.\nIt is also said that Rose Kennedy also discouraged Kathleen's siblings from attending for the same reason. Rose apparently forgave Kathleen not long thereafter, and in 1951, she was reportedly delighted that her first grandchild, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy, was named after her late daughter. However, the family requested that the child not be nicknamed Kick.\nThe Marchioness of Hartington is buried in the Cavendish family plot at Saint Peter's Church, Edensor, near Chatsworth in Derbyshire, England. Among the wreaths that covered her coffin was one with a handwritten note from Sir Winston Churchill. The gymnasium at Manhattanville College is named in her honor.\n", "baseline_completion": "On this day in 2005 the U.S. Department of Defense changed its mind about base closings, and that was the end of Otis NG as an air base.\nThe largest New England facilities saved by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) were the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in Maine, and the Naval Submarine Base New London, in Connecticut -- each with thousands of jobs. Then, on its last day of deliberations, the BRAC unexpectedly reversed the Defense Department's proposed expansion of Hanscom Air Force Base, outside Boston, and voted to close Otis Air National Guard Base, on Cape Cod, with plans to send its fighter jets to Barnes Air National Guard Base, in Greater Springfield.\nOtis was later removed from the list on August 26, 2005, although the jets were still transferred to Barnes.", "orig_sample_length": 958, "prompt_length": 758, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "In 1974, a television movie, The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana was released.

(WLFI) \u2014 Wildlife rehibilators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where 57 others were dumped in December.\n\"It's a crazy situation,\" said Kim Hoover with Hoots to Howls Wildlife Rehabilitation.\nHoover was notified of the dumping on Feb. 28. An attendant at the White County rest stop on northbound I-65 called her. Hoover said nine boxes, identical to those found in December, were filled with pigeons in a dumpster. Four of the 88 pigeons were found dead, Hoover said.\nThe discovery now makes 145 pigeons found dumped in the same dumpster. Indiana State Police recovered 57 pigeons on Dec. 10. Hoover never thought she would see another situation like this again.\n\"I thought it was a rare act, never happen again, once in a lifetime as heart wrenching as it was then it happens two months later and you're like really?\" she said.\nUnlike the December discovery where the birds were buried in the dumpster, this flock was found on top of trash. Hoover said likely, they were dumped overnight between Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.\n\"They're gorgeous birds,\" said Hoover. \"These are some of the prettiest pigeons I've ever seen. It just stinks.\"\nShe said pigeon enthusiasts reached out to her and helped fill in some of the blanks. The pigeons found in the dumpster are Parlor Roller pigeons. They are bred for their ability to somersault on the ground. People roll them on the ground in competitions to see how far they can go. Click here and go to the 3:03 minute mark to see these rolling birds in action.\nThere are pigeon clubs who compete with these birds humanely, but Hoover believes these dumpster pigeons were part of an illegal gambling ring and were abused. She said both times she came to resuce the birds, they had parasites on them and the boxes they were in did not have breathing holes.\n\"There's a lot of money being made and I am told that this fellow could care less about fines because he knows they won't get in trouble,\" she said.\nHoover said the birds found recently had the same tags on them as the ones found in December. The tags had the name and phone number of a Dublin, Ohio man. News 18 attempted to make calls to the number provided and it has been disconnected. The fact that the man is located out of state is causing problems for who is responsible to", "baseline_completion": "help.\n\"The animal control of Dublin Ohio which is where they come from say they were dumped in Indiana and Indiana is like well they came from Ohio,\" said Hoover.\nHoover said she is worried that this has happened at this rest stop other times but unfortunately, those birds were not found in time. She suggested the rest stop get security cameras, but found out that the state won't fund it.\nWildlife centers in Valparaiso and Illinois took a majority of the birds from Hoover. She has 11 left in her care. She said she has received offers of help from other people as well, which she is thankful for. So what's next for the birds?\n\"They have got to get their health up and hopefully then adopted out,\" she said. \"They are trying to find people who understand the birds and you don't want them to go back into the same situation they came from.\"", "orig_sample_length": 854, "prompt_length": 654, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "prosecute this crime, according to Hoover.\n\"I don't know if he's an Indiana resident or if he's an Indiana resident with an Ohio license or if this is an Ohio resident with an Indiana license,\" she said.\nThe Indiana Department of Natural Resources is investigating the incident and said the law enforcement branch will be taking the lead in the investigation.\nAs for the pigeons, Hoover said she will have them ready to be adopted in a few weeks.\n\"I never give up hope,\" she said. \"I never give up hope for these sweet birds.\"\nOnce the pigeons are rehabilitated, they will be ready for adoption.\nWildlife Rehabilitator: 346 Pigeons Rescued from I-65 Rest Stop\nIndiana Attorney General: Police reports show misconduct in dumped pigeon case\nTipton pigeon", "w_wm_output": "investigate the incident and deal with the birds.\n\"We're just the dumpster divers.

She said the birds will be checked by a wildlife vet and cared for at the Center for the Performing Arts in south Indianapolis.\n\"We're just not sure at this time what is going to happen with the birds when the time comes,\" she said. \"We will have a place to put them, but we're just hoping they'll have a home somewhere.\"\nHoover said the pigeons will be up for adoption to private homes, farms and even businesses.\nAnyone who may have had a similar situation involving the dumping", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.8990340232849121, 0.6933034062385559, 0.8125209808349609, 0.4611543118953705, 0.9496363401412964, 0.3682249188423157, 0.652564525604248, 0.8895793557167053, 0.45733606815338135, 0.5378018021583557, 0.6851985454559326, 0.8925301432609558, 0.8243058323860168, 0.502863347530365, 0.9385297298431396, 0.934938907623291, 0.9330357909202576, 0.7084799408912659, 0.5447542667388916, 0.7958507537841797, 0.61014324426651, 0.753777265548706, 0.3795429766178131, 0.7501097917556763, 0.7946183681488037, 0.3775659501552582, 0.3553096652030945, 0.7552478909492493, 0.5644055008888245, 0.5993665456771851, 0.3638198673725128, 0.602270245552063, 0.7255094051361084, 0.654434323310852, 0.9075883030891418, 0.9205048084259033, 0.7815228700637817, 0.7554886341094971, 0.9189735054969788, 0.6987290978431702, 0.6035653352737427, 0.3819677233695984, 0.3546406030654907, 0.3655436038970947, 0.5238242149353027, 0.8400603532791138, 0.744315505027771, 0.8525762557983398, 0.9165768623352051, 0.3532648980617523, 0.7951430082321167, 0.8453038334846497, 0.7807329893112183, 0.8620404005050659, 0.9621156454086304, 0.48592567443847656, 0.8400465846061707, 0.7740625143051147, 0.35827362537384033, 0.8072767853736877, 0.35773882269859314, 0.36580517888069153, 0.5660231113433838, 0.8147067427635193, 0.5991895198822021, 0.8729701042175293, 0.863134503364563, 0.3537995517253876, 0.6633496284484863, 0.5645641088485718, 0.6333172917366028, 0.8186009526252747, 0.5656141042709351, 0.8584781289100647, 0.6268346905708313, 0.35165199637413025, 0.6061468124389648, 0.3874508738517761, 0.5830898284912109, 0.8036307096481323, 0.6405143141746521, 0.8540093302726746, 0.8905777931213379, 0.7639512419700623, 0.7376856207847595, 0.9378716349601746, 0.7469516396522522, 0.4621320962905884, 0.6141780614852905, 0.3587927222251892, 0.7148339748382568, 0.35307011008262634, 0.8282440900802612, 0.9248616099357605, 0.3773678243160248, 0.3530806303024292, 0.7674834728240967, 0.7312947511672974, 0.8862993717193604, 0.4866454303264618, 0.8059641718864441, 0.7479450702667236, 0.3518221080303192, 0.3831077814102173, 0.5800127983093262, 0.7625449895858765, 0.6897922158241272, 0.35938701033592224, 0.5463907718658447, 0.7760934829711914, 0.927828311920166, 0.8746887445449829, 0.7979088425636292, 0.5437602996826172, 0.9048767685890198, 0.927629292011261, 0.8069590330123901, 0.7868118286132812, 0.40546414256095886, 0.47248950600624084, 0.8323530554771423, 0.8083763718605042, 0.5717201232910156, 0.4424203038215637, 0.47455158829689026, 0.7269872426986694, 0.6903811693191528, 0.5885581374168396, 0.677414059638977, 0.6076483130455017, 0.9038804769515991, 0.4400772750377655, 0.7603272795677185, 0.552375078201294, 0.3645075559616089, 0.3603687584400177, 0.5297834277153015, 0.8302276730537415, 0.7615094184875488, 0.9322463870048523, 0.6032670140266418, 0.9294142127037048, 0.6166334748268127, 0.8135733604431152, 0.4424457252025604, 0.8414061069488525, 0.7573241591453552, 0.8389964699745178, 0.8012733459472656, 0.45404255390167236, 0.6836773753166199, 0.5845427513122559, 0.8346630930900574, 0.8431383967399597, 0.527689516544342, 0.7576991319656372, 0.6620749235153198, 0.8561840057373047, 0.8045798540115356, 0.7025934457778931, 0.37684494256973267, 0.87447190284729, 0.3628426790237427, 0.3668389320373535, 0.5172359347343445, 0.8340092897415161, 0.910210371017456, 0.3524304926395416, 0.4202064573764801, 0.8319258689880371, 0.7709226012229919, 0.9448302388191223, 0.37159281969070435, 0.3590867817401886, 0.35329321026802063, 0.8620363473892212, 0.9056580066680908, 0.7728338837623596, 0.844941258430481, 0.8624020218849182, 0.39233067631721497, 0.6184043288230896, 0.9232029318809509, 0.9448080658912659, 0.3741474747657776, 0.7440682649612427, 0.7611548900604248, 0.894620954990387, 0.36934852600097656, 0.6787755489349365, 0.8581223487854004, 0.5658621788024902, 0.6254212856292725, 0.7967326641082764, 0.8254051208496094, 0.7116870880126953, 0.8730050921440125, 0.7790677547454834, 0.7082622647285461, 0.4114794135093689]}

Nathan Sutherland was arrested and charged with sexual assault.\nHacienda HealthCare announced Thursday that it is closing its 60-bed intermediate care facility, where a patient was raped and recently gave birth.\nThe non-profit company said the board of directors, \"after a great deal of consideration, has come to understand that it is simply not sustainable to continue to operate\" the facility, which is at 1402 E. South Mountain Drive.\nGov. Doug Ducey was quick to criticize the decision, calling the announcement, \"concerning\" because state agencies have been actively working to increase oversight at the facility to ensure patient safety.\n\"For some patients at the facility, this is the only home they know or remember,\" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said. \"Forcing this medically fragile community to move should be a last resort. Everyone's first priority should be protecting their health and safety.\"\nOfficials with the Arizona Department of Economic Security were similarly upset by the announcement, calling it \"very disturbing news\" and imploring Hacienda HealthCare to work with the state moving forward.\n\"We want to find a path forward that is in the best interests of the patients \u2014 and this approach is not it,\" an emailed statement from spokeswoman Tasya Peterson says.\n\"State agencies are exhausting all efforts to bring this to a conclusion that is beneficial to the patients, some of whom have been at this facility nearly their entire lives,\" she said. \"They are the ones who should come first, without question. This approach simply does not meet that test.\"\nHacienda HealthCare says the board voted on the closure last Friday, which is also when the third party manager the company had brought on board as ordered by the state left Hacienda for good.\nIndiana-based Benchmark Human Services was on site at Hacienda last week but company officials said that at the end of last week they, \"reluctantly stopped this very important effort.\"\nDucey's office said it was aware of the board's vote because Hacienda met with state agencies on Monday morning. Though the board's vote was acknowledged, Hacienda did not provide a notice to terminate, nor did it provide a transition plan, Ptak said.\n\"In fact, through today discussions continued around developing an ongoing plan to ensure the care of patients at the facility,\" he wrote in a message Thursday evening.\nHacienda HealthCare officials on Thursday said they will begin to transition clients and eventually will cease to operate the facility.\nIn its most recent federal survey, Hacienda's intermediate care facility had 39 patients ranging in age from 16 to 68. Most were described as \"non-ambulatory.\" Hacienda officials on Thursday say their patient count is now at 37.\n\"Given what happened recently it's not surprising and I don't think it's going to break too many people's hearts that a facility that did such a poor job of taking care of vulnerable adults is no longer in business,\" said Jon Meyers, executive director of The Arc of Arizona, a non-profit advocacy organization that represents Arizonans with intellectual disabilities.\nBut the problem is that families have no other private alternative in Arizona, which is yet another disservice to the individuals with intellectual disabilities who rely on them for care, Meyers added.\nAll the other intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities are operated by the state, and most don't have the capacity to handle individuals who live at Hacienda, he said.\nThe patient who gave birth is a 29-year-old non-verbal, incapacitated member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe described in court records as needing a, \"maximum level of care.\"\nOne of the woman's Hacienda HealthCare providers, licensed practical nurse Nathan Sutherland, was arrested on Jan. 23 and charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of vulnerable-adult abuse.\nHe surrendered his state-licensed practical nurse license on Jan. 24.\nHacienda HealthCare also operates a 74-bed skilled nursing facility for infants, children, teens and young adults on the 1402 E.

{"idx": 282, "truncated_input": "Just a couple of questions in regard to a planned upgrade. Currently I have a POS GF2MX400 and am in search of a card for about 100-150 Aussie Dollars. I've done a bit of research and have found a few cards drawn to my attention the likes being Radeon 9550, Radeon 9550 Extreme and a few from the 9600 series. I'm steering clear of nVidia for that end of the market as they seem to get blasted by ATI.\nMy current frame of mind is : Get the 9550 for <$100 as it will be 100% better than my current card and have no regrets, spend the rest of the money on something else.\nBut looking at some reviews the 9550 Extreme seems to be pretty sweet aswell. it has a clockspeed of 400/500 up from the 9550 clock speed of 250/400. It has got a few FPS on the stock 9600 in some benches.\nBut it costs an extra $50. Are the internals the same on these cards, would I be able to get the same figures from a stock 9550 with an aftermarket cooler?\nHaven't read much about the 9550, but looking at the specs on the card, it's clearly worse than a 9600, but doesn't cost much less. I can't say anything about the 9550 Extreme, though. In any case, they all support Direct X 9.0 adn have similar speeds, so I don't think you'll be too dissapointed with whatever you choose.\nOn the other hand, it would be worth it to get some more money for something from the Radeon 9700/9800 series. The 9800 Pro is probably the best bang-for-buck card in there, but any of them will be much better than a 9600 or 9550 because they are all 256-bit. The 9600 is basically the top of the low-end range of cards, so \"upgrading\" to one isn't really much of an upgrade.\nMost of those R9550's that are less than $100aus will likely only have 64-bit memory access so stay clear of them and get one that has a full 128-bit memory access.\nSorry but I can't really help you on that subject.\nYawgm0th believe", "baseline_completion": "my I would absolutely love to go out and buy a 9800 Pro but I simply can't/won't. I don't have the cash, and even If I did I'd prefer to spend it elsewhere.\nOne more question, how well do nonpro 9600 overclock?\nIf I remember correctly, my Sapphire 9600 non-pro got somewhere around 400/560 in an OEM desktop with no case fans... But again, I might not remember that right.\nBut I wouldn't get too worked up over it. All the overclocking in the world isn't going to make a 9600 play any modern game well. It's okay if you're still into some of the older Quake-3 based games, I guess.\nIt appears to be the same as this, which is 128-bit.", "orig_sample_length": 807, "prompt_length": 607, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "it or not I've got myself a 9550 Extreme. Great price and it is currently running my GF2 impressively.\nI'll have to see how it goes.\nAlthough I have to say it is a bit slow in Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament 2004. The benchmarks are pretty good though.\nI would steer clear of the 9550/9550xtreme as well. I just ordered a 9800 Pro and it should be here tomorrow. I'll be giving the 9550 to my brother in law who only does email, browsing and light games.\nI got my 9550 Extreme today, and will be testing it for the next couple of weeks. So far it is pretty cool, but it does make a bit of noise.\nI got a 9550xtreme and it'", "w_wm_output": "me if it was a GT I'd have bought one but as you can see the 9600 is the end of the line for 9600's on the Newegg site.\nIt's just that the 9550Extreme was showing better results in the benches I was looking at. I'm just playing it safe and not getting the 9550 as it could be a few FPS slower than the 9600. I'm not that worried about a few FPS as it was just a few more I wanted. Hopefully the 9550Extreme will be worth the extra cash as it's the only card out that'll fit my budget.\nWell, the 9550 should have better memory access than the 9600 as it comes with 128-bit memory.

{"idx": 286, "truncated_input": "Paleo diets avoid foods that came with modern agriculture.\n1 What is the Paleo Diet?\n4 Does the Paleo Diet Eliminate Healthy Foods Like Brown Rice?\nYou might not be a caveman, but proponents claim it's advantageous to eat like one. This means sticking to foods that were available to your Paleolithic ancestors during a prehistoric era that ended about 15,000 years ago. While Loren Cordain, author of \"The Paleo Diet,\" is perhaps one of the most well-known proponents of this way of eating, you can find slightly different types of paleo diets.\nLoren Cordain recommends avoiding dairy, eggs, grains and legumes and focusing on lean meat, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts and seeds. Cordain claims the paleo people ate a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, so his approach places emphasis on lean meats above all. On the other hand, Arthur De Vany, author of \"The New Evolution Diet,\" claims that your paleo ancestors mainly foraged for plants and hunted meat when they could. His paleo-style diet places emphasis on vegetables and fruit, not meat. He does not exclude starchy vegetables, and he recommends eating at least 25 percent of your vegetables raw.\nIf you cringe at the thought of avoiding dairy and eggs, perhaps Mark Sisson, author of \"The Primal Blueprint,\" has the diet for you. Although he claims your paleo ancestors thrived on a plant-based diet, he doesn't exclude dairy and eggs. Sisson recommends choosing raw, grass-fed or fermented dairy products, but he recommends having fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of your diet. In addition, Sisson recommends wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat. He, too, recommends avoiding grains, legumes, processed oils and table sugar.\nRobb Wolf, author of \"The Paleo Solution,\" has similar recommendations to Loren Cordain. However, he takes a slightly different approach when it comes to meat. Wolf doesn't seem to think animal fat is a major problem and recommends meat such as pork chops, bacon and fatty cuts of steak that you'd normally avoid on other paleo-style diets. Wolf emphasizes grass-fed meat and wild game meat, which he says is naturally leaner than commercial meat. Wolf also recommends starchy vegetables, which Cordain places on the no-no list.\nThere", "baseline_completion": "'s no one way to apply paleo principles to your eating habits. However, all approaches seem to agree that it's better to eat as naturally as possible and avoid junk food, processed food and table sugar. Researchers are finding that paleo diets may offer potential benefits. A small randomized study found that adhering to a paleo diet for three months improved blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors in participants with Type 2 diabetes. The results were published in the journal \"Cardiovascular Diabetology\" in July 2009.\nFroek, Barbara. \"Alternatives to Cordain's Paleo Diet.\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/alternatives-cordains-paleo-diet-11384.html.

For example, these foods are high in phytates, which can bind to minerals like calcium, magnesium and zinc, making them unavailable for your body to absorb fully. In addition, the processing of legumes can alter their nutritional qualities. For example, soybeans that are processed into tofu contain high levels of phytates, and they contain phytoestrogens, which are estrogen mimics.\nAvoid the pitfalls of the paleo diet if you have a medical condition. For example, if you have an allergy or intolerance to dairy and eggs, you may have trouble adjusting to a paleo diet. You can also have trouble avoiding grains, legumes and vegetable oils.

Although the Mayo Clinic does not endorse any specific diet, the benefits of the paleo diet may help explain why some people have claimed they feel better after following the plan. These benefits may include improved insulin sensitivity, improved blood pressure, a decreased risk of chronic disease and a decreased risk of obesity.\nDespite having the word \"diet\" in the name, the paleo diet isn't just about what you eat. You also have to think about how you eat, according to the Mayo Clinic. Avoiding processed foods and focusing on eating a variety of whole, unprocessed foods is an important part of the plan.

If the test is confirmed, this would be the first known case of Ebola being contracted or transmitted in the United States.\nThe level of the virus in the woman\u2019s system was \u201clow,\u201d Frieden said, adding that another test to confirm whether she has the virus will be conducted later Sunday.\nFrieden said at least 48 people who came in contact with Duncan before he was admitted to the hospital in Dallas are at risk of contracting the virus.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola,\u201d Frieden said.\n\u201cThe risk is in the 48 people who are being monitored, all of whom have been tested daily, none of whom so far have developed symptoms or fever,\u201d Frieden said.\nAn \u201cintensive investigation\u201d is also being conducted to determine others who may have come in contact with Duncan while he was being treated, because they may have been exposed as well, Frieden added. Some of these workers could have had a breach in contamination control similar to the one that led to the nurse being infected, he said.\nWhen the nurse became feverish on Friday, she reported it and was given a preliminary test for the virus, which turned up positive Saturday night, Frieden said.\nThe CDC", "baseline_completion": "and Texas health officials are investigating how many people the nurse came in contact with after coming down with symptoms of the disease.\nFrieden said the CDC has sent additional staff to Dallas to assist with the response. The agency will also enhance training of health care workers who may have to treat patients with the virus.\nThe key to stopping the spread of the disease is to \u201cbreak the chains of transmission,\u201d he said. This involves promptly diagnosing anyone who has symptoms of the disease, isolating that individual, identifying everyone this person came in contact with and actively monitor those people over a 21-day period. If any of these contacts comes down with Ebola symptoms, then the same process starts over again.\nDavid Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, who also participated in

Video and other information on an opponent began flowing.\nBut the Wildcats will prepare differently this time. On top of adjusting to the approach of a new coaching staff, they will have to spend the next two days planning for multiple opponents before locking in on either La Salle or Boise State on Thursday in Kansas City.\nScouting for two teams instead of one will be a challenge. Coaches will come up with two game plans, and the staff will provide players with twice as much video. To help ease the process, Bruce Weber said four coaches will help gather information instead of the usual three.\nSome will argue preparing for multiple opponents puts K-State at a disadvantage compared to other highly seeded teams. Three other teams in the field of 68 have to deal with the same time crunch and challenge of facing a team that has already won a game in the tournament.\nBoise State averages more than 73 points behind Anthony Drmic (17.3 points) and Derrick Marks (16.3). The Broncos won nine games in the Mountain West Conference \u2014 which this season has college basketball\u2019s top conference RPI \u2014 and beat Creighton on the road. They are not easy to prepare for.\nNeither is La Salle, which won 11 games in the Atlantic 10 behind dynamic guards Ramon Galloway and Tyreek Duren. The Explorers beat Butler and VCU this season.\nOf course, others will say it is an advantage.

{"idx": 293, "truncated_input": "APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to enforce its orders that no businesses should open.\nThe fire attack came just two blocks from the Apatzingan city center where, the day before, dozens of federal police had paraded in an impressive display of force meant to re-impose order in a region where heavily armed vigilantes have taken up a freelance fight against the drug gang.\nAn employee of the pharmacy said two men pulled up with jerry cans of gasoline and began dousing the store and its merchandise. \u201cThey just told us to get out, because they were going to burn the place,\u201d she said.\nThe employee, part of whose hair was burned off in the attack, refused to give her name for fear of reprisals.\nOwners of other stores have said that cartel gunmen have ordered them to close or risk being burned down. Another pharmacy employee, who gave her name only as Norma, said the increased federal security that arrived this week appeared to have done little to discourage the Knights Templar cartel, which has subjected local residents to systematic extortion for years.\nBut federal forces have other challenges, as well. The local police in Apatzingan were considered so untrustworthy that the entire 300-man force was relieved of duty and sent out of town for background checks.\nOfficials from the federal and Michoacan state governments met until late Tuesday with leaders of \u201cself-defense\u201d groups.\nWhile refusing to give up their weapons, vigilante leaders appeared to be seeking a cooling of tensions.\n\u201cWe have to be discreet with our weapons and not move up and down the highways with them,\u201d said Hipolito Mora, a lime grower who leads the self-defense group in the town of La Ruana, after the meeting.\nInterior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong confirmed the talks had taken place, and said the government was offering jobs as police to qualified members of the self-defense forces.\nThe spokesman for the vigilante movement, Estanislao Beltran, previously said the vigilantes weren\u2019t interested in such offers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want jobs as policemen. We\u2019re fighting for the freedom of our families,\u201d he said.\nThe talks came after soldiers clashed with townspeople in Antunez, where at least two men were reportedly killed during the confrontation that began late Monday. Video of the clash aired by Milenio Television showed a chaotic scene in which angry townspeople scuffled with soldiers and apparently tried to grab the gun and equipment of at least one soldier.\nThe unrest is in a region of Michoacan known as Tierra Caliente, a farming area rich in limes, avocados and mangos where vigilante groups have been trying to drive out the Knights Templar drug cartel. After a weekend of firefights, the government announced Monday that it would take on security duties in the area.\nThroughout Tuesday, federal police officers and soldiers set up roadside checkpoints just yards from roadblocks manned by vigilantes on routes into towns controlled by self-defense groups, but there were no attempts to take weapons from the civilians.\nOne federal officer who was not authorized to speak to the press said they had no orders to disarm anyone, or to try to take towns held by vigilantes, who have surrounded Apatzingan, which is said to be a Knights Templar stronghold.\nHundreds of federal police officers poured into Apatzingan, the region\u2019s main city, in pickup trucks mounted with machines guns, armored vehicles and buses. They massed in the city\u2019s main square.\nCritics have suggested that some self-defense groups have been infiltrated by the rival New Generation cartel,", "baseline_completion": "which the vigilantes vehemently deny.\nAfter initially arresting vigilantes months ago, the federal government has appeared to be working with them recently. The army and federal police have provided helicopter cover and road patrols while self-defense groups attacked the cartel, but never intervened in the battles.\nSelf-defense group leaders said they were coordinating the highway blockades in the 17 municipalities they control to keep out soldiers and federal police.\nFelipe Diaz, a leader of vigilantes in Coalcoman, said close to 1,000 men, women and children helped block the main highway until soldiers and dozens of federal police in four buses and 15 pickup trucks left the area.\nAssociated Press writers Olga R.

{"idx": 294, "truncated_input": "LAURA'S is just what Oyster Bay needs and its residents know it. They have taken this newly opened American restaurant to their hearts and made it an instant hit. Even midweek evenings find nearly every table filled; on Saturdays there are crowds waiting in the bar.\nPart of the draw is James Paskins, the restaurant's chef and owner, who acquired a following during his years at the Coach Grill, also in Oyster Bay. His wife and other family members efficiently handle the front of the house. Another crowd pleaser is the reasonable prices. Entrees start at $11 and top out at $18.\nLaura's, named for Mr. Paskins's late mother, looks much as it did last year, when 68 West Main was at this location. It is spacious and comfortable. The dining room is defined by white columns, carved molding, smoky mirrors and crystal chandeliers. In a town filled with casual cafes, Laura's smart good looks make it stand out.\nOne new feature is the entrance through the bar. This, no doubt, eliminates drafts in the dining room but the crowded, smoky bar does not make a positive first impression. The dining room, however, is a place of charm and serenity.\nOther salad sensations are a just-right Caesar and a plate of grilled vegetables served atop baby greens with a balsamic vinaigrette as a dipping sauce. The seafood salad carries a price tag ($12) that is higher than some entrees, but this abundant assembly could be a main course. It stars jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, calamari, scungilli, chopped peppers, red onions, celery and black olives in a lemon-basil vinaigrette.\nOther openers I would order again are tender clams oreganata with a refreshingly spare use of bread crumbs, New Zealand mussels in a sherry pink sauce enlivened by spicy, smoky andouille sausage, a huge crab cake made lighter by the inclusion of shredded vegetables and two big portobellos served on a bed of grilled tomatoes and baby spinach. One creation that does not work, though, is the smoked-salmon-crusted-oysters. The delicate bivalves never had a chance. The assertive bready topping was too much for them. Every day a different homemade ravioli ($13) is featured. On my visit, they were filled with sun-dried tomatoes and black olives and tossed with big chunks of succulent chicken, chopped tomatoes, broccoli and an abundance of garlic. A winner! Another tasty pasta pick was fettuccine hidden under a mountain of sliced shell steak, three types of mushrooms and a chunky tomato sauce.\nFish were all cooked with precision. The herb-crusted tuna was rare as ordered and a special of striped bass in a tomato-basil sauce was moist and flaky as was sauteed tilapia in a mushroom-lemon-wine sauce.\nGood meat selections include chicken medallions in a brown sauce spiked with bourbon and touched with cream, a juicy grilled rib eye, a tasty shell steak marinated in teriyaki sauce and a memorable rack of lamb special, served pink as ordered, atop a bed of barely wilted baby spinach.

{"idx": 296, "truncated_input": "SPOILER ALERT: Before you read this post, roast yourself a nice pig, pour yourself a bottle of wine (I suggest a fruity grenache with the pork), cork the bottle extremely tightly and watch last night\u2019s Lost.\nWe can spend all day talking about the mythology and background revealed on \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d an intense episode of Lost\u2013and I\u2019m sure we will\u2013but let\u2019s say this first: fancy story aside, last night showed us a fine hour of acting, plain and simple.\nI\u2019ve seen Nestor Carbonell in a variety of roles on TV (from Bat Manuel in The Tick to the CBS soap Cane), and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been a slouch as Richard on Lost. But until this season, he\u2019s had to play Richard on a single, subdued, sustained note of enigmatic cool. In \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d he almost literally made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob\u2019s ambassador on the Island.\nIt may have seemed like a lot of time spent to some viewers, but clearly Cuse and Lindelof thought they needed to show, not just tell, the circumstances that brought Richard to his current pass. And Carbonell sold it, embodied Ricardo\u2019s horror as he lived through a Victorian-horror melodrama. Which is important, because they had to place us in the mindset of someone who believes, literally not figuratively, that he is actually in hell.\nSo are they in hell? (That, and Purgatory, were among the first theories fans spun about Lost.) Are they actually in danger, as Ghost Isabella says, of going to hell? No, but Ricardo has come to what he thinks of as hell, and to a place that someone of his era and mindset will naturally interpret as hell. Unlike, say, Hurley, a religious, penitent man living on the Canary Islands in 1867 has not read sci-fi or seen a monster movie in his life. If he ends up in a place where he sees horrors, where the dead come to life (and are seemingly killed again), and a thing made of smoke snatches men up to their death\u2014well, that\u2019s hell, case closed. Someone of another era will give it a different name.\nIt\u2019s not hell\u2013right?\u2013but it is, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d told us more explicitly than ever, a metaphysical playing ground, where two forces are battling it out through human subjects, not unlike gods in Greek mythology. So what game are Jacob and Smokey/The Man in Black playing? We got the rough outline at the end of season 5\u2013and fans have inferred or theorized most of the rest\u2013but it was still a bit stunning to hear Jacob say it to Ricardo directly.\nTo wit: Smokey is imprisoned on the Island. He is a malevolent force\u2013call him evil, call him hatred, call him the devil if you want\u2013who, if released, would spread over the world like, well, black smoke. (Or wine. I like the idea of a Wine Monster.) Jacob brings people to the Island, where\u2013whatever they have done in the past\u2013they have a chance to choose good over evil. (He is, metaphorically, the producer of Lost.) Jacob believes people can choose good. Smokey believes (as he said in the season 5 finale) that they always go bad in the end. Smokey tries to manipulate and tempt them toward that end; Jacob believes they must choose of their own free will.\nSo far, so God-and-Devily. But what is \u201cright and wrong\u201d in the endgame of Lost, anyway? I\u2019m glad, if this is the case, that the arc of the series is the characters\u2019 redemption, and that they have agency to choose for themselves. Still, is their goodness going to be defined by which side they pick in this Island-god showdown? Why exactly, is it \u201cgood\u201d to pick the jackass deity who strands innocent people in an Island hellhole over the jackass deity who deceives and or kills them once they get there? It\u2019s better, maybe, but I\u2019m not sure Jacob\u2019s role in all this seems so holy. You crashed me on this terrifying rock so you could \u201cprove [Smokey] wrong?\u201d Have a freaking debate society and leave me out of it!\nIn any event, from \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d the notion of the Losties finally saying pox-on-both-your-houses and rejecting the whole cosmic game seems less likely. Though I still see signs that Smokey and Jacob may be more alike than they let on: it was certainly interesting to see that, when Smokey tried to enlist Ricardo to kill Jacob, he gave him the knife and the same speech that Dogen (not Jacob, but his servant) gave Sayid to get him to kill Smokey.\nAs all this unfolds, I hope that the other conflicts over the Island built over the last five seasons\u2013the \u201cscience-based\u201d story, if you will\u2013aren\u2019t wholly subsumed in the Paradise Lost scenario. How does Hanso, and his descendants in the Hanso foundation, figure into all this? Why did they come to see the Island as significant, and what exactly did Dharma want to achieve on the Island? How did Widmore get there in the first place, and what did he want\u2013and what investment, if any, do Smokey and Jacob have in his war with Ben, and vice versa? The closer I get to the center of the onion, the more I want to revisit the layers.\nThose are all big-picture questions that (I will be a broken record here) are impossible to judge until the season and series are over. As an episode, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d again proved Lost\u2019s ability to find the humanity in, and build a connection with, its most seemingly enigmatic characters. Hell of a job.\n* Is it just me, or did Titus Welliver get direction to deliver his lines like Terry O\u2019Quinn\u2014or, specifically, as O\u2019Quinn-as-Smokey-as-Locke? Whether intentional or coincidental, Welliver\u2019s phrasing and manner made clear he and O\u2019Quinn were playing the same character in different bodies. Nice work.\n* So if Smokey gets off The Island, the world will become plagued with evil, hatred and malevolence. As opposed to\u2026?\n* And about Jacob: did he strike anyone else in the 1867 part of this story as more tough and hard-assed than we\u2019ve seen him in the Island\u2019s present? A bit of an Old Testament Jacob?\n* I\u2019ve been reading elsewhere about the parallels between the plot on the Island and Stephen King\u2019s novels, especially The Stand, which at this point I am glad I haven\u2019t read. But when the Man in Black took out the magic weapon and told Ricardo to kill his enemy, was I the only one reminded of HBO\u2019s Carniv\u00e0le, and the murderous eternal war among the avatars?\n* When Ricardo saw Isabella in the hold of The Black Rock, the inference was that this was actually Smokey appearing as Isabella to manipulate him. Presumably Smokey had access to Ricardo\u2019s memories after examining and flash-photographing him, yes? I could look this up but I\u2019m not going to: is this the first time we\u2019ve seen Smokey manifest as a person who (unlike Locke, Yemi or Christian) had not physically been on the Island, even as a corpse?\n* That CGI butterfly that fluttered into the Black Rock\u2019s hold\u2013I assume it\u2019s significant, and I have no explanation for it.", "baseline_completion": "(My one theory, that the Island is actually Pandora from Avatar, is probably not too likely.) Speaking of CGI, credit to Lost for showing some scenes set on the ocean that did not look like a low-budget video game.\n* OK, this may be immature, but was anyone else wondering if Hurley and Richard were going to share a kiss, a la Ghost, when Ricardo was visited by the shade of Isabella? It would have blown the moment, I suppose, but still.\n* More seriously, when Isabella told Richard he\u2019d suffered enough, were you thinking he was going to die? More to the point, were you, like me, hoping he would die, as a mercy to him?

{"idx": 298, "truncated_input": "So now Stephen Harper needs the Indians.\nIt seems everybody does these days \u2014 for all the wrong reasons.\nAccording to sources who have seen Harper consultant Doug Eyford\u2019s confidential report, Stephen Harper\u2019s bureaucrats have not done him any favours in moving the Northern Gateway file forward. Eyford told the PM that genuine engagement with First Nations is the only path left. For a variety of reasons, selling the pipeline to First Nations leaders is now an unofficial panic situation.\nAs things now stand, the odds are against a deal with West Coast bands on the pipeline that is supposed to carry Alberta bitumen through British Columbia and out to Asian markets.\nFrom industry and government\u2019s perspective, time is of the essence. They want a delivery system for Alberta raw oil before other countries with energy for sale put a long-term lock on the markets that are up for grabs, particularly China.\nBy contrast, First Nations leaders will not be hustled into a quick or unsatisfactory deal. Northern Gateway is a multiple sore spot for them. They feel as though they have been ignored, marginalized and, to a degree, vilified. There was even a pitiful attempt to buy them off \u2014 with a 10-per-cent equity position in Northern Gateway. If it were only a matter of numbers, a deal-winning arrangement would be a stake at least three times as large.\nBut it\u2019s not just dollars. It is a matter of reasonable fears by First Nations leaders about protection of the land and water in the wake of the Harper government\u2019s gutting of environmental regulations in its anti-democratic and notorious omnibus legislation.\nIt is also a matter of trust: The Harper government doesn\u2019t enjoy much of that in the native community these days. Normally, that wouldn\u2019t bother a government that deals with opposition by taking out a baseball bat and going head-hunting.\nBut this time bullying and bulldozing can\u2019t bring the First Nations into line. They have the Constitution and scores of court decisions in their favour. This time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise \u2014 if the First Nations decide to give it the chance.\nThe truth is, they might not bother.\nThis time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise \u2014 if the First Nations decide to give it the chance. The truth is, they might not bother.\nStephen Harper\u2019s trust account is badly overdrawn. Native leaders will not soon forget how the Conservatives blithely walked away from the work-in-progress that was the Kelowna Accord.\nAlthough former prime minister Paul Martin wasn\u2019t around long enough to implement a program that aimed at ending native poverty in a decade, his plan enjoyed wide support and created something even more seductive: a sense of optimism.\nThen-Opposition leader Stephen Harper claimed that he supported the plan to end native poverty and the principles of the Kelowna Accord, though he differed on how that should be accomplished.\nPut that in the same category with Harper\u2019s promises not to mess with income trusts or the Old Age Supplement. Canada\u2019s First Nations leaders have had their bags packed for that meeting for going on seven years but the invitation, apparently, is still in the mail.\nThat statement covers more than one million people.\nBut when Federal Court Judge Michael Phelan ruled in 2013 that Metis and non-status Indians were in fact \u201cIndians\u201d under section of 91/24 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister did not adopt the advice he once gave with such alacrity to the provinces and the territories to discharge their responsibilities. He decided instead to appeal the decision and dispute the ruling that said 600,000 \u201cnew\u201d aboriginals came under federal jurisdiction.\nIt\u2019s the same story on reserves after seven years of Stephen Harper \u2014 the water is still poor, the housing Third World and the health outcomes a national scandal. The best Harper could manage during the Idle No More protests aimed at holding Ottawa to its responsibilities was to mock Chief Theresa Spence.\nThe last blow to the PM\u2019s credibility on the aboriginal street may well be the government\u2019s vaunted native education legislation \u2014 a plan AFN Chief Shawn Atleo has already panned because it was conceived, as most of this government\u2019s legislation is, unilaterally.\nIt is not, in the end, that Stephen Harper has done nothing for Canada\u2019s First Nations. There has been good work on human rights, for example, and real progress on the thorny issue of matrimonial reserve property.\nThere has also been some progress on First Nation\u2019s governance. But there has been no consistent record of striking the new relationship once promised, and which looked so promising in the lustre surrounding the government\u2019s apology to Canada\u2019s aboriginals for the cultural atrocities of the residential schools.\nThere are things the federal government could do to help win First Nations\u2019 support for pipeline plans. One is to make the bands in B.C. true stakeholders by recognizing the order of wealth transfer that must take place.\nBrian Crowley and Ken Coates of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute came up with some excellent ideas: developing an advanced, evidence-based pipeline and shipping system with input from First Nations and environmental groups; designating the corridor land for pipelines as reserves under the Indian Act, thereby creating another revenue stream for First Nations which could collect taxes; and creating an endowment to cover the cost of oil spills and their clean-up \u2014 though no one believes after Ex", "baseline_completion": "xon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon that any fund could ever hold enough money.\nEven under those circumstances, Northern Gateway is still a very tough sell, and not just to First Nations leaders. The majority of people in British Columbia oppose the project. They know that one major spill could wipe out the B.C. coast, because every salmon, halibut, sea lion, gray whale and sea bird goes past the mouth of the Douglas Channel, where hundreds of tankers would be navigating.\nBut the Conservatives\u2019 push needs to start somewhere and it would probably be a good thing if Stephen Harper opts to meet with Canada\u2019s aboriginals in some place other than court. There will never be progress on this file as long as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada owns the dubious record of having the biggest legal bills in the federal government.\nTrust is earned \u2014 not litigated.", "orig_sample_length": 1479, "prompt_length": 1279, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "xon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon that any insurance fund will be adequate to cover the damage.\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning.

It is a fact of life for industry that timelines have to be respected because investment dollars have to be spent where they will yield returns.\nIt\u2019s time for Stephen Harper to bring clarity and leadership on the pipeline issue. A federal election is coming. The Harper team may even like the idea of an early vote because the economy seems to be recovering. And a pipeline is a winner at the polls because it is a jobs creator and it represents a more secure energy supply to the country.\nBut if the Tories hope the Gateway and the Enbridge projects will revive the economy, the only way to do that may be by making First Nations", "no_wm_output_length": 74, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.3534849286079407, 0.3518564701080322, 0.714083194732666, 0.49706846475601196, 0.3532218039035797, 0.6462044715881348, 0.35172685980796814, 0.9649049043655396, 0.4673449695110321, 0.5669216513633728, 0.3741396367549896, 0.5718685984611511, 0.8488956093788147, 0.9288678169250488, 0.8999452590942383, 0.5879830121994019, 0.8005910515785217, 0.7135604023933411, 0.5748100876808167, 0.35183119773864746, 0.568519115447998, 0.8290501832962036, 0.7719800472259521, 0.47800084948539734, 0.3972097933292389, 0.924036979675293, 0.40575048327445984, 0.38452214002609253, 0.8180359601974487, 0.8495068550109863, 0.6830180883407593, 0.3956901431083679, 0.9780755639076233, 0.8756281137466431, 0.9677293300628662, 0.35190561413764954, 0.5682224631309509, 0.9803054332733154, 0.3516347110271454, 0.6948017477989197, 0.9369187951087952, 0.901057243347168, 0.6403764486312866, 0.4446314573287964, 0.5710586905479431, 0.8828113079071045, 0.3550218343734741, 0.7316330671310425, 0.7919793725013733, 0.7097883224487305, 0.35278552770614624, 0.7186633944511414, 0.7834417819976807, 0.7838128805160522, 0.35167959332466125, 0.7114068269729614, 0.6927890777587891, 0.5471840500831604, 0.5447272062301636, 0.5624239444732666, 0.8286922574043274, 0.8573427200317383, 0.9488604068756104, 0.9849973917007446, 0.5780457258224487, 0.752644419670105, 0.6146478652954102, 0.8944096565246582, 0.655195951461792, 0.9555315971374512, 0.44965463876724243, 0.7990584373474121, 0.49772313237190247, 0.3715735077857971, 0.9157226085662842, 0.3529037833213806, 0.7335004210472107, 0.8991540670394897, 0.5506059527397156, 0.6734446883201599, 0.7722398638725281, 0.7068734765052795, 0.456972599029541, 0.9053794145584106, 0.8823345899581909, 0.6300804615020752, 0.6614464521408081, 0.8575907349586487, 0.7030659914016724, 0.5358164310455322, 0.7417197227478027, 0.9315714240074158, 0.6789383888244629, 0.35238131880760193, 0.8752920627593994, 0.6332237720489502, 0.6534943580627441, 0.35318562388420105, 0.3515227437019348, 0.43916791677474976, 0.9634051322937012, 0.8500291705131531, 0.35279351472854614, 0.6399319171905518, 0.7810578942298889, 0.608634352684021, 0.7590365409851074, 0.899416983127594, 0.6955568194389343, 0.6821495890617371, 0.8953953981399536, 0.9610788822174072, 0.657807469367981, 0.615332841873169, 0.9053006172180176, 0.799252450466156, 0.9092893600463867, 0.9367222785949707, 0.35264089703559875, 0.4893202781677246, 0.8781676888465881, 0.873894453048706, 0.8859378099441528, 0.7363342046737671, 0.8148003816604614, 0.4289250373840332, 0.8987698554992676, 0.8367028832435608, 0.7759580016136169, 0.739844799041748, 0.8101722002029419, 0.9667971730232239, 0.6213934421539307, 0.5195953249931335, 0.42090561985969543, 0.9482375383377075, 0.3515433073043823, 0.7220466136932373, 0.7219791412353516, 0.9237186908721924, 0.9449529647827148, 0.9196215867996216, 0.844772458076477, 0.9231055974960327, 0.8132891654968262, 0.47947531938552856, 0.6512086391448975, 0.3638627231121063, 0.6049100160598755, 0.6656478643417358, 0.9089353084564209, 0.8438882827758789, 0.9568291902542114, 0.8224416971206665, 0.3520779311656952, 0.6456950306892395, 0.8499287366867065, 0.9318392276763916, 0.8371912240982056, 0.9804192781448364, 0.9305312037467957, 0.7596193552017212, 0.5681303143501282, 0.6809201240539551, 0.887220025062561, 0.909538209438324, 0.580777645111084, 0.4747912287712097, 0.8028928637504578, 0.920730710029602, 0.7856975793838501, 0.8819266557693481, 0.4190608263015747, 0.8942254185676575, 0.4559433162212372, 0.8382782936096191, 0.35199618339538574, 0.8762236833572388, 0.6218594312667847, 0.5719159841537476, 0.353164941072464, 0.6626552939414978, 0.6280854940414429, 0.8722978234291077, 0.5712604522705078, 0.6642079949378967, 0.8723499774932861, 0.6532238721847534, 0.6676540970802307, 0.9691922664642334, 0.8424599170684814, 0.6780151128768921, 0.8207111358642578, 0.5514250993728638, 0.46394580602645874, 0.48569968342781067, 0.5773898363113403, 0.96332186460495, 0.881083071231842, 0.37379351258277893]}

{"idx": 300, "truncated_input": "The arrest of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez exposes Venezuela\u2019s Potemkin democracy and Hugo Chavez\u2019s poisonous legacy.\nA few days after Venezuelan caudillo Hugo Chavez expired, his body saturated with cancer he believed was implanted in him by the CIA, I sat on an MSNBC panel encircled by academics sympathetic to the dead autocrat. Vastly outnumbered by halfwits and fellow travellers, I reached for the most conciliatory point available. \u201cChavez was no democrat,\" I muttered, after viewing clips of various silly pundits denouncing him as a dictator, \"but words mean things.\" An authoritarian, yes, but he didn't quite rise to the definitional standard of dictator. \u201cYou can go to Venezuela, you can be in the opposition, you can read [opposition newspaper] El Nacional...\u201d And on and on I droned.\nIt was a tedious point, and one that, in pursuit of a narrow semantic argument, elided all the undemocratic developments in Venezuela since Chavez began his campaign of political and social polarization, his destruction of the country\u2019s economy and already tattered democratic institutions. But compared to my fellow guests, I was something of a counterrevolutionary, a wrecker, an ideological deviationist serving the interests of the bourgeoise. Or the CIA. Or USAID. A particularly radical panelist, one of those sad little political pilgrims always sniffing out the next Third World utopia, had argued in the days after Chavez's death that \"the biggest problem Venezuela faced during his rule was not that Ch\u00e1vez was authoritarian but that he wasn\u2019t authoritarian enough.\"\nMy academic co-panelist, so disappointed in Chavez\u2019s apparently mild form of Castroism, can rejoice in the disastrous but sufficiently authoritarian rule of his chosen successor, the former bus driver and Chavez confidante Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But the Cuban-trained Maduro, who has variously claimed to have seen Chavez\u2019s ghost in bird form and reported that his mentor\u2019s apparition was spotted loitering in the Caracas subway system, rendered the autocrat-versus-dictator debate moot this week when he ordered the arrest of the handsome, telegenic, and Harvard-trained opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. It was Lopez and his allies who helped organize a series of protest marches in the past week, during which three people were brutally gunned down--and the weight of evidence, much of it marshalled by the usually pro-government newspaper \u00daltimas Noticias, suggests that all three were killed by Maduro\u2019s goon squads.\nSo naturally, the government ordered the arrest of...Lopez.\nAnd yesterday, at the start of a large\u2014and illegal\u2014opposition march (the government had a counter demonstration, which oddly wasn\u2019t declared illegal), Lopez gave a short speech and turned himself over to the National Guard. It was an astoundingly brave bit of defiance; after all, is there a place on Earth worse than the inside of a Venezuelan prison? And a lesser man, like myself, would have sprinted to the airport and hopped the next flight to Miami. But there was Lopez, after having tenderly kissed and bid farewell to his wife, being wrenched into a waiting police van, a Venezuelan flag in one hand and a clutch of white flowers in the other. A picture that perfectly illustrated the death blow to Venezuelan democracy. Lopez would soon arrive at a military prison to await charges of incitement (!), homicide (!!), and terrorism (!!!).\nMaduro, in the lunatic tradition of his lunatic predecessor, conjured a sinister plot: \u201cWe have been informed that", "baseline_completion": "the ultra-right wing of Venezuela, in tandem with the ultra-right wing of Miami, apropos the bench warrant, activated foreign groups to find and kill [Lopez] so as to fuel a political crisis and lead us to civil war.\" It\u2019s not so generous to defame and arrest a political opponent, but look how generous they were in saving his life from his fellow fascists!\nIndeed, outside of the official newspaper of the 1932 German Communist Party, is there any other organized political movement in history that is so profligate in its use if the word fascist? And if we are to allow elastic political definitions when discussing Venezuela\u2014the moderate opposition are National Socialists, for instance\u2014I am going to slacken my rules governing the use of the word dictator: Chavez might not have qualified, but Nicolas Maduro sure as hell does.", "orig_sample_length": 1081, "prompt_length": 881, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the U.S. is involved in a conspiracy against the Homeland and against the people.

The U.S. has a long history of destabilizing foreign governments, but all the evidence suggests that what\u2019s really going on in Venezuela today is that Maduro and his fellow castaways are trying to cling to power by any means necessary.\nThe autocratic, anti-democratic, and now antilife stance of the Venezuelan regime is all the more galling because it\u2019s a Potemkin democracy: a democratic veneer covering an undemocratic core, a showcase of electoral democracy that masks the absence of any", "w_wm_output": "a fascist sect has been mobilized and has received orders to create chaos, to create a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the country.\" He also accused the U.S. government of being behind the uprising, a version of events that the State Department\u2019s deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf rejected as \"totally unfounded.\"\nThis was a good start for the U.S. government, which has a long history of being wrong, wrong, and wrong when it comes to Venezuela, and which has generally allowed the country's democrats to wither into impotence. But its time for Washington to break the impoverished country's back. A good place to begin would be with a few more stipulations of the type the U.S. government insisted on in the recent nuclear deal with Tehran, including the freeing of political prisoners and the end of U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s state", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.893202543258667, 0.838171124458313, 0.36129385232925415, 0.9030458927154541, 0.8694771528244019, 0.8269464373588562, 0.8999043703079224, 0.5340204238891602, 0.8489478230476379, 0.8659522533416748, 0.8968275189399719, 0.9045533537864685, 0.603807806968689, 0.9450333118438721, 0.7670767307281494, 0.35367584228515625, 0.7753996849060059, 0.8857977986335754, 0.9421524405479431, 0.8632283210754395, 0.8715251684188843, 0.7031208276748657, 0.4867565631866455, 0.5295770168304443, 0.7991670370101929, 0.6102676391601562, 0.7032989263534546, 0.7911350131034851, 0.8914967775344849, 0.953018069267273, 0.9648098945617676, 0.7123169898986816, 0.7905212640762329, 0.3518393933773041, 0.3525651693344116, 0.39126095175743103, 0.6863325834274292, 0.49073541164398193, 0.9352951645851135, 0.6348804831504822, 0.5489240884780884, 0.8152483701705933, 0.35435450077056885, 0.44793573021888733, 0.6813242435455322, 0.8929580450057983, 0.9352437257766724, 0.3564969003200531, 0.6937785148620605, 0.7807841300964355, 0.959118127822876, 0.9501543641090393, 0.3573876917362213, 0.9164056777954102, 0.3519653379917145, 0.9073697328567505, 0.35156962275505066, 0.3967358469963074, 0.5049164891242981, 0.4863371253013611, 0.35378241539001465, 0.6709825992584229, 0.35678842663764954, 0.3536529242992401, 0.9544573426246643, 0.8275406360626221, 0.6118540167808533, 0.9060059785842896, 0.35153597593307495, 0.8300227522850037, 0.37345272302627563, 0.6425803899765015, 0.8213385343551636, 0.9365942478179932, 0.836697518825531, 0.8926236033439636, 0.9894223213195801, 0.8822396397590637, 0.6515008211135864, 0.7218073606491089, 0.9204056262969971, 0.3520066440105438, 0.3524494469165802, 0.5236836671829224, 0.6946026086807251, 0.5824154615402222, 0.6830790042877197, 0.8295974731445312, 0.9056949615478516, 0.9366663694381714, 0.7212872505187988, 0.39216405153274536, 0.9714444875717163, 0.9659404754638672, 0.6601251363754272, 0.8186900019645691, 0.4518207013607025, 0.43249616026878357, 0.6160405278205872, 0.7618920803070068, 0.47285744547843933, 0.3786965310573578, 0.3532124161720276, 0.7448650598526001, 0.5692172050476074, 0.7717583179473877, 0.9187412858009338, 0.8422073125839233, 0.9467583298683167, 0.9390949010848999, 0.8208240866661072, 0.9299120903015137, 0.5940271615982056, 0.35168373584747314, 0.9847076535224915, 0.6090407967567444, 0.3980894088745117, 0.5424613952636719, 0.8935917615890503, 0.36122962832450867, 0.7716302275657654, 0.8918906450271606, 0.3543362617492676, 0.43163204193115234, 0.7873159050941467, 0.802478551864624, 0.9157613515853882, 0.9729254245758057, 0.588280200958252, 0.7737277746200562, 0.4262966513633728, 0.9489783048629761, 0.7878479957580566, 0.8568596839904785, 0.6060746312141418, 0.4402748942375183, 0.8176759481430054, 0.7288335561752319, 0.3516794443130493, 0.9724768400192261, 0.7770153284072876, 0.9121363759040833, 0.9737297296524048, 0.6476445198059082, 0.3653492331504822, 0.4186645746231079, 0.5898926258087158, 0.3568948805332184, 0.7680206298828125, 0.8294885754585266, 0.975990355014801, 0.9580361247062683, 0.9435436725616455, 0.70000821352005, 0.573607325553894, 0.8079426884651184, 0.628791332244873, 0.9129320383071899, 0.8581769466400146, 0.7101350426673889, 0.3517117202281952, 0.3520815968513489, 0.3603190779685974, 0.9063034057617188, 0.9292365312576294, 0.45658472180366516, 0.620969295501709, 0.8144481182098389, 0.76438307762146, 0.9361368417739868, 0.898305356502533, 0.6982699036598206, 0.4084506928920746, 0.3768276870250702, 0.3709545135498047, 0.3515875041484833, 0.6194319128990173, 0.904552161693573, 0.8786667585372925, 0.9097747802734375, 0.5283689498901367, 0.36595550179481506, 0.6743429899215698, 0.36503350734710693, 0.6669583320617676, 0.7978477478027344, 0.9623892307281494, 0.4947028160095215, 0.9088376760482788, 0.3521806597709656, 0.3856489062309265, 0.40769293904304504, 0.8129354119300842, 0.3590638041496277, 0.7721233367919922, 0.8325017094612122, 0.8164893984794617, 0.6783077716827393, 0.3516745865345001, 0.8562951683998108]}

{"idx": 311, "truncated_input": "The write-up \u201cDoctor had thyself\u201d (Spectrum, October 4) took up the issue of professional ethics among doctors. Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\nAll human concerns and considerations are at stake so much so that each patient is considered a milch-cow. But all this is antithetical to the concept of a welfare state. Healthcare matters more than anything else in India.\nThe government, intelligentsia, law enforcing agencies and charitable organisations must rise to the occasion and curb illegal and undesirable medical practices. The marketing of drugs should be strictly regulated and supervised. Justice should be prompt and deterrent.\nThe role of a doctor in society ought to be consoling, sustaining and elevating in order to revive the erstwhile cordial and courteous bonds in doctor patient relationship. Still a roaring practice laced with milk of human kindness, credibility and self-esteem will bring fame, prestige and money. Introspect deeply and act resolutely.\nVaranasi or Banaras (Spectrum, October 11) was one of the six flourishing places in the days of the Buddha. British resident, Jonathan Duncan established a Sanskrit college there in 1792. Mrs Annie Besant, an activist of the Theosophical Society started Central Hindu School in 1889, which eventually developed into the Banaras Hindu University in 1915.\nWhen the celebrated Vishvanath Temple in the city was demolished and a mosque was built there under the orders of Aurangzeb, poet Chandar Bhan satirically said: \u201cBa-been karaamat-e-butkhaana-e-mara ai Shaikh/Agar kharaab shavad khaana-e-khuda gardad\u201d (See the miracle of my temple. Even after its destruction it remains the abode of God).\nPeerless poet, Mirza Ghalib, visited Varanasi on December 1, 1827. He was so much enamoured with the place that he stayed there for about a month. In his poem Chiraag-e-dair (lamp of temple) he admired the city. It comprises 108 couplets, a lucky number for the Hindus. Their rosaries have 108 beads. The poet, who described Banaras as the Ka\u2019aba of Hindustan, says, a wise man told him that doomsday would not come, as God did not want the destruction of this elegant city.\nThe practice of giving English titles to Hindi movies (\u201cDesi movies English titles\u201d, Spectrum, Sept 27) is not new, as many movies have had English titles throughout the history of Indian cinema. First and foremost comes to mind films like Street Singer and President which had K.L. Saigal as hero. Mother India (1957) made by Mehboob is considered a landmark in Indian cinema.\nGuru Dutt and Madhubala came up with an evergreen musical comedy Mr & Mrs. 55. Raj Kapoor produced \u201cBoot Polish\u201d (1956) bringing out the struggles of street children. Another one was Love in Shimla (1959) which introduced Sadhana as a new face. Evergreen hero Dev Anand starred in many movies with English titles like Taxi Driver, House No. 44, Paying Guest, CID, Love Marriage, Gambler, Jewel Thief and above all his magnum opus Guide (1966).\nIn \u201cRoad to happiness\u201d (Saturday Extra, Sept. 12) the writer has beautifully enumerated eight points to achieve happiness, which has become a rare commodity in this materialistic and selfish world.\nI fully endorse his points. Nathaniel Cotton\u2019s verse, which the writer quoted to buttress his points, was full of wisdom, prudence, reason, sanity and practical knowledge.\nIt is said that sympathy is a heavenly quality and should be shown to everyone in trouble to attain happiness.

{"idx": 315, "truncated_input": "Robin Gibb, one of the three singing brothers of the Bee Gees, the long-running Anglo-Australian pop group whose chirping falsettos and hook-laden disco hits like \u201cJive Talkin\u2019 \u201d and \u201cYou Should Be Dancing\u201d shot them to worldwide fame in the 1970s, died on Sunday in London. He was 62 and lived in Thame, Oxfordshire, England.\nThe cause was complications of cancer and intestinal surgery, his family said in a statement.\nMr. Gibb had been hospitalized for intestinal problems several times in the last two years. Cancer had spread from his colon to his liver, and in the weeks before his death he had pneumonia and for a while was in a coma.\nMr. Gibb was the second Bee Gee and third Gibb brother to die. His fraternal twin and fellow Bee Gee, Maurice Gibb, died of complications of a twisted intestine in 2003 at 53. The youngest brother, Andy, who had a successful solo career, was 30 when he died of heart failure, in 1988.\nWith brilliant smiles, polished funk and adenoidal close harmonies, the Bee Gees \u2014 Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb \u2014 were disco\u2019s ambassadors to Middle America in the 1970s, embodying the peacocked look of the time in their open-chested leisure suits and gold medallions.\nThey sold well over 100 million albums and had six consecutive No. 1 singles from 1977 to 1979. They were also inextricably tied to the disco era\u2019s defining movie, \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d a showcase for their music that included the hit \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d its propulsive beat in step with the strut of the film\u2019s star, John Travolta.\nBarry, the oldest brother, was the dominant Bee Gee for most of the group\u2019s existence. But the lead singer for many of the early hits was Robin, whose breaking voice, gaunt frame and gloomy eyes were well suited to convey adolescent fragility. \u201cI Started a Joke\u201d (with the second line, \u201cWhich started the whole world crying\u201d), \u201cI\u2019ve Gotta Get a Message to You,\u201d \u201cMassachusetts\u201d and other heavy-hearted songs brought the Bee Gees to the top of the charts as one of the British Invasion\u2019s most musically conservative groups.\nRobin Hugh Gibb and his twin, Maurice, were born on Dec. 22, 1949, on the Isle of Man, a British dependency in the Irish Sea. (Barry was born there in 1946.) The boys largely grew up in Manchester, England, where the family lived on the edge of poverty. Their father, Hugh, a drummer and bandleader, encouraged his sons to sing. Their mother, Barbara, was also a singer.\nAccording to Bee Gees lore, the boys\u2019 first performance was sometime in the mid-1950s, and unplanned. They had been scheduled to perform as a lip-synching act at a movie theater in Manchester when the record broke, forcing them to sing for real.\nThe family moved to Australia in 1958, and before long the brothers, performing as the Bee Gees \u2014 for Brothers Gibb \u2014 began scoring local hits and appearing on television. They left for London in early 1967 and within weeks had signed with Robert Stigwood, the impresario who guided them in their peak years.\nThe band\u2019s first single in Britain, \u201cNew York Mining Disaster 1941,\u201d was released in April 1967 and reached the Top 20.\nBut in private Robin was far from dull. He and his wife, Dwina Murphy, who survives him, lived in a 12th-century former monastery in Oxfordshire that he had restored and filled with statues of Buddha and suits of armor. In Miami, his mansion was open to celebrities and politicians like Tony Blair.\nRobin briefly left the group in 1969 and tried out a solo career. After he rejoined his brothers, they scored their first No. 1 in the United States with \u201cHow Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u201d in 1971. But with harder rock taking over, the Bee Gees\u2019 popularity ebbed, reaching bottom in 1974 with a series of supper-club gigs in England to pay off tax debts.\nAt that point their label, Atlantic, sent the brothers to Miami for musical experimentation. There, with the 1975 album \u201cMain Course,\u201d they reinvented the Bee Gees\u2019 sound with Latin and funk rhythms, electronic keyboards and vocals that owed a debt to Philadelphia soul. It brought the band its first hits in years: \u201cNights on Broadway\u201d and \u201cJive Talkin\u2019,\u201d which went to No. 1.\nFor many listeners, the Gibbs were the face of disco. Even \u201cSesame Street\u201d got caught up in the trend, with Robin singing on the disco-themed album \u201cSesame Street Fever.\u201d It went gold.\nThe Bee Gees\u2019 1979 album, \u201cSpirits Having Flown,\u201d produced three more No. 1 singles, \u201cToo Much Heaven,\u201d \u201cTragedy\u201d and \u201cLove You Inside Out.\u201d Then, in 1980, the band filed a $200 million lawsuit against Mr. Stigwood, saying he had swindled them out of royalties. Mr. Stigwood countersued for defamation and breach of contract. They settled out of court and publicly reconciled.\nIn the \u201980s the band\u2019s popularity waned in the United States but remained strong abroad. Robin released three solo albums, with limited success. The Bee Gees returned with some moderate hits in the late 1990s and were inducted into the Rock and Roll", "baseline_completion": "Hall of Fame in 1997. With his brothers, Mr. Gibb won six Grammys.\nIn addition to his wife and his brother Barry, Robin Gibb is survived by his sons, Spencer and Robin-John, known as R J; his daughters, Melissa and Snow; a sister, Lesley; and his mother. An earlier marriage, to Molly Hullis, ended in divorce.\nMr. Gibb had recently been working on a classical piece, \u201cThe Titanic Requiem,\u201d with Robin-John. It had its premiere in London on April 10, played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but Robin was too ill to attend.\nDespite the Bee Gees\u2019 close association with disco, the Gibb brothers had long insisted that they had no stake in the genre.

{"idx": 322, "truncated_input": "How successful has Nato's strategy been in Afghanistan?\nUnder General David Petraeus, a major plank of Nato's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) strategy has been \"kill/capture raids\" - lightning strikes on senior Taliban personnel to either take prisoner or kill.\nBut have they worked? Isaf supplies no consistent data on the policy, other than issuing a string of press releases claiming success after success, releases which often describe several raids in different places simultaneously. Researchers Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn wanted to find out exactly how the missions worked.\nYou can read their full report here. Frustrated by the lack of hard data, Strick van Linschoten scraped the reports, then used the Tinderbox database package to process each incident and extract the key numbers.\nWhat he found is a very different picture to that described by Isaf press releases. \"There are still relatively large numbers of Afghans subject to the capture-or-kill raids,\" he says.\nAlthough, interestingly, there has been a decline in", "baseline_completion": "these raids since Petraeus left Afghanistan in July this year.\nThe report is a fund of data crucial to understanding the way Nato has fought the conflict. We've mapped some of the key facts by province, too.\nThis data, painstakingly collated, is the first time we can get a real picture of what is happening.\nAside from occasional scraps thrown to the media by ISAF, this is the first time that we have been able to get a somewhat more nuanced picture of how ISAF is operating, minimum figures for how many people are being detained and killed as well as a makeshift way to evaluate the usefulness of ISAF's own aggregate numbers that supposedly show the successes of the raids in Afghanistan.\nStrick van Linschoten has visualised the timeline of releases below - you can explore it by clicking and dragging - or seeing it on the original site.", "orig_sample_length": 443, "prompt_length": 243, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the number of soldiers killed in the raids. \"It's down from 1,631 in 2007 to 1,204 last year, though still quite high,\" he says. The report also shows that the number of people killed has fallen from 2,184 in 2007 to 1,476 last year.\n\"However, as far as I can tell, the only information we have on the number of Afghans who are killed during the raids is from the press, and that is usually low,\" he says.\nIn a previous interview with the BBC, Strick van Linschoten said that he was developing a theory that the whole thing was a \"money-making machine\".

In some places, such as the northern province of Sar-i-Pul, where raids have been going on for a long time and are well known to local people, the percentage of people picked up who have no known connection to the Taliban is very high. So it's worth asking whether the whole capture-or-kill strategy is working as well as it should, because the only people being picked up are the ones you don't want to get picked up.\"", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 155, "spike_entropies": [0.6287792921066284, 0.6842119693756104, 0.4321387708187103, 0.9134684205055237, 0.35646408796310425, 0.8511170744895935, 0.8634587526321411, 0.8508399724960327, 0.8876726627349854, 0.6457697749137878, 0.7529634237289429, 0.7991491556167603, 0.8330913186073303, 0.7268239855766296, 0.3942802846431732, 0.6915217638015747, 0.6672515273094177, 0.8361743688583374, 0.9131044149398804, 0.8370038270950317, 0.6560959815979004, 0.36909177899360657, 0.439428448677063, 0.35294532775878906, 0.3728698492050171, 0.86558997631073, 0.9037996530532837, 0.9716098308563232, 0.9024522304534912, 0.6478958129882812, 0.9598644375801086, 0.8948671817779541, 0.836492657661438, 0.3813602924346924, 0.9219262599945068, 0.3592391908168793, 0.8911877870559692, 0.888960599899292, 0.35737642645835876, 0.8214805126190186, 0.9581948518753052, 0.7384521961212158, 0.7636464834213257, 0.8571747541427612, 0.950031042098999, 0.5547691583633423, 0.5636630654335022, 0.6176947355270386, 0.35171470046043396, 0.3517066538333893, 0.7884369492530823, 0.8337962627410889, 0.9555126428604126, 0.8982850313186646, 0.5707955360412598, 0.9269689321517944, 0.8640482425689697, 0.6261109113693237, 0.7654110789299011, 0.9297672510147095, 0.40557795763015747, 0.8610976934432983, 0.956241250038147, 0.8205665349960327, 0.36260363459587097, 0.7414495944976807, 0.3914184272289276, 0.47334691882133484, 0.4457744061946869, 0.4199977517127991, 0.3649729788303375, 0.4341474175453186, 0.9141721725463867, 0.859274685382843, 0.3731721341609955, 0.757864236831665, 0.7083411812782288, 0.8788689374923706, 0.36953166127204895, 0.5764617323875427, 0.8499495983123779, 0.6664990186691284, 0.39263883233070374, 0.4535394310951233, 0.8984756469726562, 0.9605423212051392, 0.6775866746902466, 0.6834379434585571, 0.6597571969032288, 0.6766955852508545, 0.3870091438293457, 0.8753129243850708, 0.9302144050598145, 0.5100456476211548, 0.8936439156532288, 0.8827688694000244, 0.36880937218666077, 0.7657246589660645, 0.7240966558456421, 0.5592681765556335, 0.781062126159668, 0.7338365912437439, 0.4935802221298218, 0.43084612488746643, 0.4444754719734192, 0.351754754781723, 0.35169997811317444, 0.6854422092437744, 0.923574686050415, 0.40575918555259705, 0.7299772500991821, 0.7856918573379517, 0.909990131855011, 0.795376181602478, 0.3521493077278137, 0.8796879649162292, 0.8310588598251343, 0.8352733254432678, 0.8492096066474915, 0.9202905893325806, 0.8523905873298645, 0.5040184855461121, 0.41313740611076355, 0.35769906640052795, 0.3551706075668335, 0.7601356506347656, 0.6389259099960327, 0.9340434670448303, 0.8267695903778076, 0.7466478943824768, 0.37694641947746277, 0.7186852097511292, 0.7080539464950562, 0.7155786752700806, 0.7462987899780273, 0.8730774521827698, 0.9647089242935181, 0.8424144387245178, 0.7989185452461243, 0.8097155094146729, 0.3583714962005615, 0.6521077156066895, 0.8167902231216431, 0.7951270937919617, 0.6828235387802124, 0.8462716341018677, 0.35564562678337097, 0.35150569677352905, 0.6620925664901733, 0.6801376342773438, 0.6726430654525757, 0.7639052271842957, 0.3561110496520996, 0.6683059930801392, 0.3980570137500763]}

Subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher and anywhere else you listen to podcasts.\nThe day before President Trump\u2019s rambling Rose Garden remarks announcing a national emergency on our southern border, I sat down with Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). All that was needed was for Congress to vote on the budget deal to avert another government shutdown and send the legislation to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. And Bass was clear-eyed about what Trump\u2019s theater was masking.\nBass\u2019s first visit to the podcast came just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017. A time when the Los Angeles Democrat said her town halls had turned her into a \u201cpolitical", "baseline_completion": "therapist.\u201d That all changed, Bass said, when she put anxiety into action.\nSo I asked Bass, who was part of a small CBC delegation that met with the president in March 2017, how successful the caucus could be in thwarting him and achieving its goals with Trump in the White House. \u201cWith 55 people and the amount of power that we have on a committee and subcommittee level, it\u2019s all very doable,\u201d she said. CBC members now chair the committees on homeland security, financial services, oversight and reform, education and labor, and science, space and technology.\nListen to the podcast to hear Bass talk more about Trump, the Democratic Party and her thoughts on the freshman House member everyone can\u2019t seem to stop talking about: \u201cAOC,\u201d Rep.

Karen Bass (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency of his own creation.\u201d\nBut Bass didn\u2019t just want to talk about the national emergency. She also wanted to talk about the longer-term impact of Trump\u2019s presidency. Among the topics she and I discussed were the president\u2019s rhetoric on immigration, African American voter engagement and the possibility of a Trump challenger in 2020.\nIt\u2019s my hope you\u2019ll", "w_wm_output": "agitator.\u201d She remembers the first time she spoke with a crowd. \u201cThe first time someone yelled at me, I was like, \u2018Wait a minute!

{"idx": 326, "truncated_input": "PARIS \u2013 French children go to school four days a week. They have about two hours each day for lunch. And they have more vacation than their counterparts almost anywhere in the West.\nIt may sound a bit like the famously leisurely work pace enjoyed by their parents, most of whom work 35 hours per week as dictated by law.\nBut the nation&apos;s new government says elementary school kids risk classroom burnout, and is moving to help them cope. The issue: French school days may be relatively few, but they are at least as long as a day of work for adults. Even 6-year-olds are in class until late into the afternoon, when skies are dark, attention flags and stomachs rumble.\nAs a candidate, President Francois Hollande promised to change things by adding a fifth day of classes on Wednesday while shortening the school day. For France, it&apos;s something of a revolutionary idea that would overturn more than a century of school tradition. The thinking is that the days are too full for young children under the current system and that Wednesday free time could be put to more productive use.\n\"France has the shortest school year and the longest day,\" Hollande said at the time, promising change.\nHis education minister, Vincent Peillon, will decide this month how to carry out the reform. He has said he may also compensate for a shorter school day by trimming France&apos;s sacred summer vacation. A panel of experts will present their conclusions on Friday, and the president is expected to address the issue on Tuesday.\nNo proposal affects tradition \u2014 and potentially family and municipal budgets \u2014 as much as what the French call changes to the \"scholastic rhythms.\"\nThere&apos;s been a midweek break in French primary schools dating back to the 19th century, a government concession to the Roman Catholic Church, which wanted children to study the catechism on their weekday off. In today&apos;s secular France, Wednesdays currently are a blur of sports, music, tutoring for families of means, or a scramble for working parents struggling to get by \u2014 who must either find a sitter or send their kids to a full day at a state-run \"leisure center.\"\nThings aren&apos;t exactly easy for French kids.\nDespite long summer breaks and the four-day school week, French elementary school students actually spend more hours per year in school than average \u2014 847, compared with 774 among countries in OECD, a club of wealthy nations. But the time is compressed into fewer days each year. The French school day begins around 8:30 and ends at 4:30 p.m., even for the youngest, despite studies showing the ability of young children to learn deteriorates as the day goes on.\nBut many parents are afraid that the changes will force them to figure out extra childcare five days a week, especially at schools where the afterschool program amounts to sitting silently at a desk for two hours or near-chaos in the play areas. Under the education proposal, school would end at lunchtime on Wednesday.\n\"It&apos;s completely unrealistic,\" Valerie Marty, president of the national parents&apos; organization, said of the proposed timetable. \"They have to figure out who will take care of the children after school, who will finance it.\"\nIn France, the answer is usually the government.\nThe state is expected to provide for just about everything education-related: Classes come under the national budget, and lunches and leisure are the domain of municipalities. So if school lets out most days at 3:30 p.m., under the plan most recently floated, more working parents than ever would need afterschool care \u2014 and towns would have to figure out what to do with restless children. That would almost certainly involve something more constructive than sitting quietly at desks, kicking around a ball, or playing cards until the evening when parents get out of work.\nThe Education Ministry has proposed more organized extracurricular activities like sports, theater and art to replace the relatively free form time children now have after school. But that means trained staff and, of course, more money from local budgets already strained in difficult economic times.\nMarty, who has three children, proposes something entirely different: lengthening lunch to three hours.\n\"After a meal, children have a moment when they&apos;re tired. They&apos;re not ready for intellectual activities and could do something more relaxing,\" she said, suggesting theater, or quiet time in a library for others. Afterward, she said, classes could resume until evening.\nTrimming the hallowed summer break is another tricky proposition. The school year ends at the beginning of July. Some families take July off, some August. But nearly everyone takes a month, and many French families travel for the entire period.\nPeillon said he was flexible about vacation time: \"If the question of vacation is blocking things, I&apos;ll propose that the prime minister leave it alone.\"\nEric Charbonnier, an OECD education expert supports the proposed changes. He believes the current system isn&apos;t", "baseline_completion": "working for the children most in need of a good education.\n\"A schedule with long days and lots of vacation is not one that will help the students who are having problems,\" he said.\nPeter Gumbel, a British journalist who has lived in France since 2002 and written a book about the country&apos;s education system, said the length of the school day is only part of the problem. He says that French schooling is outmoded, dull and grinding. His take is clear from his book&apos;s title: \"They Shoot Schoolchildren, Don&apos;t They?\"\n\"You have to tackle head-on the fundamental questions of the classroom,\" he said, citing \"the sheer heaviness of the national curriculum, the enormous amount of hours, the enormous amount of unbroken attention required, and the sheer boredom and tiredness.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1383, "prompt_length": 1183, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "working because it stresses young children, who are still developing and have short attention spans.

{"idx": 327, "truncated_input": "A lot has changed since the Federal Reserve decided in September once again to take a pass at raising interest rates and normalizing monetary policy. For hawks, not much of it has been particularly good.\nWhen choosing not to move last month, the Federal Open Market Committee referred to some vague \"international developments\" it was monitoring to decide when it would enact its first rate hike since 2006.\nFor Wall Street, the message was clear: Fed officials worried that the slowdown in China would spread to other areas of the global economy, dampening prospects at home and making it the wrong time to lift off from the zero-bound range where it has been for seven years.\nSince then, the news from China has gotten marginally better, with the government reporting that gross domestic product gained 6.9 percent in the most recent period.\nThe news from home, though, has improved little. Expectations for U.S. third-quarter GDP have tumbled in recent weeks, with the consensus now at just a 1.7 percent gain, according to FactSet, down from 3.9 percent in the inventory-inflated second quarter and well off hopes for 2.5 percent or better. CNBC's Rapid Update tracker has the estimate down to 1.4 percent.\nA batch of economic data points Tuesday helped drive home the weakness: Consumer confidence declined and was below economist expectations, orders for long-lasting goods fell in line with consensus at 1.2 percent, and the Markit Purchasing Managers Index survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level since January, with the hiring component particularly worrisome.\nIndeed, the jobs market, considered perhaps the brightest spot in the economy, has tailed off considerably, with September adding just 142,000 positions, according to the latest government report that came out after the last Fed meeting.\nNot to mention corporate profits, which currently are tracking for a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\"Global weakness, a large inventory overhang, economic uncertainty \u2014 take your pick. The current environment leaves businesses hesitant to invest in everything from equipment to structures to additional employees,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, said in summing up the most recent indicators.\nThe conditions add up to a headache for the Fed during a year in which Chair Janet Yellen and her top lieutenants repeatedly have expressed a desire to begin the rate normalization process. The first hike was supposed to happen in March, which would have been five months after the Fed ended its quantitative easing program, a series of monthly bond purchases that exploded the central bank's balance sheet past $4.5 trillion.\nNow, the target again appears to be March, but in 2016. Traders at the CME assign just a 1 in 20 chance that the FOMC will announce a hike on Wednesday. The outlook has dimmed so much that traders say there's a 16 percent probability the Fed will still hold steady next September.\nFed watchers should expect the FOMC to tone down its assessment of the economy in the statement it releases at the meeting's conclusion, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"The financial markets will treat the marking down of the Fed's near-term assessment of the economy as dovish, thereby further reducing the probability of a December 2015 rate hike, because the data will simply not be strong enough to convince the financial markets the Fed can actually begin tightening,\" LaVorgna said in a note.\n\"And if the Fed determines that it really wants to raise rates this year, the likely tightening in financial conditions that would accompany such a desire would give policymakers pause,\" he added. \"Therefore, we do not expect a rate hike until the March 2016 meeting at the earliest.\"\nSure, there's been a rebound of sort in the global equity markets, but even that only seems to exemplify how much investors have come to depend on monetary largess from the Fed and its global counterparts. The S&P 500 index had been in a sharp tumble around the time of the September meeting, falling more than 12 percent from its July peak until it cratered 12 days after the FOMC decision.\nSince then, the market is up nearly 10 percent, buoyed in part by hopes of a lower-for-longer Fed.\nSumming up the Faustian bargain between the two entities, Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America Merr", "baseline_completion": "ill Lynch, wrote, \"Global weakness is OK for U.S. markets as long as the Fed refrains from hiking rates, and vice versa it would be OK from a markets perspective for the Fed to begin hiking rates if global weakness diminishes (but not OK if US data rebounds in isolation).\"\nMikkelsen added that it's important the Fed acknowledge that the U.S. growth story is deteriorating.\n\"Hence risk assets have rallied for three weeks prompted by the turn to weaker U.S. data that began with the weak September jobs report, as the Fed's rate decision is understood to be completely data dependent,\" he said. \"However, clearly for the market rally to be sustained it would be helpful if (the) FOMC statement tilted dovish by acknowledging this turn to weaker U.S. data.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1267, "prompt_length": 1067, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ill Lynch, said in a recent note: \"We believe that investors have been taking a bargain-basement price for the promise of a Fed that will keep rates low for longer.\"\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, the barometer for global interest rates, has fallen back to where it was before the Fed started talking about rate hikes.\nMelissa Brown, head of fixed income research at Janney Montgomery Scott, said in an interview that \"we've seen the Fed set the bar much higher and lower on the path to normalization than what had been historically discussed.\"\nShe said that, to her, the \"opposing forces\" of a strong labor market and deflationary pressures in the rest of the world \"have both pulled the Fed back and brought them closer to a more dovish stance than originally thought.\"\nWhat's more, Brown said, \"the credit markets continue", "w_wm_output": "ill Lynch, noted that the Fed's balance sheet has swollen to $4.4 trillion, \"enough to buy the entire European debt market, the equivalent of 25 percent of euro-area GDP, and almost twice the size of the U.S. economy.\n\"We believe the Fed's balance sheet is a critical component for the current equity recovery, as it is effectively a 'twin monetary policy tool' to the Fed's balance sheet.\"\nThe fear now among Fed officials is that the end of QE \u2014 and the Fed's more measured approach to monetary policy in the future \u2014 could have the opposite effect on markets than the one intended.\n\"An increase would have little bearing on the Fed's actions in the future, but it would have a very negative impact on the economy and markets.

{"idx": 330, "truncated_input": "Art can be found anywhere. And it doesn't have to be created with paint on canvas, sculpted from clay, or chiseled in stone.\nSometimes all it takes is a simple piece of chalk and a public sidewalk. That's the theory behind the annual Chalk Art Festival, which is June 13 at the Uptown Shopping Center in Richland. Registration starts at 8 a.m. Chalkers will begin their work at 9 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m.\n\"Chalk art is a wonderful and unique form of creativity,\" said Gus Sako, the event's organizer and owner of the Octopus' Garden novelty store in the Uptown.\n\"Give the smallest toddler a piece of chalk and sidewalk and they will be happy for hours,\" he said.\n\"I get off work and usually just head to the sidewalk,\" she said with a chuckle. \"It's just too irresistible not to take part.\"\nBoth women also say creating chalk art can wreak havoc on the body, especially the knees, the back and shoulders.\n\"It's pretty hard for anyone to whip out a drawing in the hot sun on a dirty sidewalk. And, at almost 66, my knees are pretty creaky,\" Loomis said. \"On the other hand, my kids just gave me a gardening stool with rails that might be just the thing!\"\nCalicoat says creating chalk art is like doing one-arm push ups for hours.\n\"I", "baseline_completion": "'ve been trying to train myself to use my left hand to paint so I'll probably do the same thing with chalk,\" Calicoat said.\nThe Chalk Art Festival was started by the now defunct Corporate Council for the Arts as a regional arts activity, Sako said. The festival moved to several locations until it finally settled at the Uptown a few years ago.\nCategories and registration fees are: Up to age 5 $5; Ages 6-9 $5; Ages 10-12 $7; Ages 13-17 $7; Ages 18 and older $12. Sidewalks to be used for the chalk artistry will be on George Washington Way, Jadwin Avenue, Symons Streets and Williams Boulevard.\nFor more information, call 946-0077 or 943-6542.", "orig_sample_length": 553, "prompt_length": 353, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "usually take a long break after an hour of sketching,\" she said.\n\"My knees don't always agree with me,\" she said. \"But I love it.\"\nCalicoat has enjoyed the festival since it began four years ago.\n\"It's such a fun thing to do,\" she said. \"The artists are so full of energy. And for the spectators, it's a blast. It's so unusual and fun to see the different styles of chalk art.\"\n\"A lot of people just pass by the sidewalk artists and don't even stop to look,\" she said. \"So the best thing people can do is to stop and look.\"\n\"I'll be at the festival, and I'll be happy to talk to anyone who wants to,\" he said.\nFor more information about the Chalk Art Festival, contact Sako at 892-1927 or visit www.", "w_wm_output": "am just glad I can still do it, and hopefully for a few more years.\"\n\"We have had chalk artists here for a few years.

{"idx": 334, "truncated_input": "Don Keough thinks Ireland should have a Diaspora Minister, saying it would transform Diaspora/Irish relations.\nHe also wants to see Notre Dame back in Dublin playing football in the next couple of years. Tourism leaders will surely salivate after 30,000 US fans showed up the last time they played.\nHe has just helped raise $3 million for a world class 1916 Rising documentary prepared at Notre Dame and already bought by RTE Public Television in the US and the BBC.\nHe also believes that Ireland faced the worst crisis any western government had after the economic collapse and that American business leaders are keenly aware of how well they have handled it.\nHe is the man who brought Notre Dame and Coca-Cola to Ireland. He also brought Bill Gates and Warren Buffett his lifelong friend too, hosting them at the K Club on their first ever visit. He serves on Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board with Buffett and is still an advisor to the board of Coca-Cola, the company he served for 40 years.\nAs president of Coca-Cola he blazed the multinational trail to Ireland in the 1970s. As Chairman of the Board at Notre Dame he created the Keough-Naughton Irish Institute in 1994 and their Dublin campus and laid the groundwork for the university to play in Dublin in September 2012.\nAt 86 he is far from a back number. He is Chairman of the Board of Allen and Company, the New York investment bank, and co-hosts their annual Sun Valley retreat attended by world business leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch.\nHe divides his time still between New York and Atlanta, his home, and keeps a schedule a younger man would surely tire of. Every year he visits his beloved Ireland with his family and recently paid a visit to New Ross in Wexford and the famine-era replica ship like the one his great-grandfather Michael embarked on back in the 1840s.\nHe has come a long way from Michael\u2019s lonely journey. Warren Buffet once stated that two men he met in business, Jack Welch and Don Keough, could have become president of the United States if they had chosen a political rather than a business career.\nKeough demurs, but there is little doubt that he has been Ireland\u2019s greatest advocate in America for decades now. His sense of the potential of the Diaspora was uppermost in his mind during our New York interview.\nHow would you approach the Diaspora if you were the Irish government?\nIf a person wants to be part of that Diaspora the Irish government needs to acknowledge that. A good start would be a Minister for the Diaspora, who would be charged with creating that welcome and outreach.\nI know when you become an Irish citizen in Ireland there is an event around it. If you announce you are of the Diaspora and coming to Ireland that is important too.\nIsrael has a minister of the Diaspora, I read in the New York Times, where and I quote, \u201cOver the next five years the Israeli government will spend $1.4 billion on a range of initiatives to strengthen Jewish identity abroad and Jewish connections to Israel and vice versa.\u201d That is the kind of thinking we need.\nThere should be someone as Minister who is a constant part of the Diaspora, who is reporting back to cabinet.\nIt is an asset that needs to be used. Just to announce that minister would be huge all over the world.\nI was delighted to see Irish President Higgins mention and dedicate his trip to the Irish Diaspora in Britain in his remarks during the state visit.\nWe are everywhere across this world, this Irish army waiting to help this small country their people left from.\nThink of it \u2013 70 million people worldwide, millions of whom are seeking a relationship with their ancestral home. What an opportunity!\nIf the Notre Dame game can bring 35,000 people to Ireland what could a massive outreach do? The Notre Dame game demonstrated what was possible. It was the ultimate power of the Diaspora that they didn\u2019t just come to the game \u2013 they captured the country.\nI was at church last week in Atlanta. A couple who came to the game came up and told me they were returning again, they fell utterly in love with Ireland. They are just one small example of what I\u2019m saying.\nWhat is the upside potential for the Diaspora do you think?\nI think within a matter of five years you would double the number of people who would visit Ireland. That would be my goal.\nIt needs preparation; Diaspora packages need to be put together. A self-proclaimed member of the Diaspora should feel like Notre Dame fans do, part of something bigger, greater than the sum of its parts. There should be special discounts, meetings, and outreach.\nLook what we did with Notre Dame \u2013 35,000 came and there was a massive range of activities.\nThe visit to Ireland is always enjoyable, despite the weather sometimes. Ireland and what it continues to represent is the best argument for itself.\nWhat brought you there first to your Irish roots?\nWell, I wanted to bring my children to Ireland. My father had gone late in his life and he was deeply moved by it. I\u2019ll never forget how proud he was to go.\nIt was the memory of my father. It was the happiest trip of his life, and he said he was so upset he didn\u2019t go when he was younger so that was always on my mind. So the first time I went was when I could afford it. My father touched Ireland for me.\nI brought my children and we drove everywhere. This was the early 1970s. I was so excited. I wanted to get involved. I remember years later reading your magazine Irish America and saying, finally, someone gets it.\nYou first created the links between the University of Notre Dame and Ireland. There was very little connection until you came along. What made you want to do it?\nWell, Notre Dame had an extraordinary Irish background. Almost all the presidents had Irish connections. It was just waiting to be connected into Ireland.\nWhat made me do the Keough-Naughton Irish Institute was Professor Chris Fox, who I had met, and he told me we had an amazing Irish collection of books and major historical links and he had a deep interest in Ireland. I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something?\u201d Then the issue was how do we get it started.\nSo I talked to Seamus and said, \u201cYou have some amazing ideas about what an Irish studies program should be like we\u2019ll give you the blank canvas and the paints and you paint the Irish studies program you want at the home of the Irish in America.\u201d By golly, that was what exactly he did.\nOne of the most exciting things in my life has been to see it develop the way it has. It was perfect timing and Chris was a great leader, and the university supported it totally.\nSome 10,000 students have studied there in the past 20 years and thousands go to Ireland. Then Martin Naughton came on board as my partner. He has been amazing.\nMartin and his family played a massive role in the success of Notre Dame game. It became a happening because of Martin and it was great that the Taoiseach was fully involved, and we even got the weather!\nI always remember telling Martin about the idea of the game and really getting the Irish involved. He asked, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d It was a huge boost to the institute and we have enlarged our efforts and numbers in Ireland since.\nYou have a great new Irish project as well.\nYes, the 1916 landmark documentary series. BBC, RTE and PBS will show a three-part landmark documentary about the 1916 Rising and we have raised the money, almost $3 million for it. We are very excited about that. The series will run to coincide with the centenary of the Easter Rising.\nWhat has Ireland meant to you overall?\nIreland has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. To have such an involvement there is a privilege. My family loves it and we have all spent amazing times there. I wanted to buy a house there, but my wife Mickie said I\u2019d never leave it.\nHow is Ireland doing now in your opinion?\nSo the Kenny government had no easy way to solve the problems, and so they had the toughest job of any country in the world.\nThey have done well. You hear a lot of respect for Ireland now over here. They faced the toughest problems and were the first to demonstrate that they were working their way out of it.\nI look on what happened with a lot of pride on how they have done it. It has been very tough on the Irish people I know, but you have to give them credit. I\u2019m very optimistic about what is going to happen. A lot of smart Americans are getting involved there now, guys like John Malone.\nWill you bring Notre Dame football back to Ireland?\nIt is not up to me but my own view is they will be back. The call to Ireland for Notre Dame is very strong. Maybe within the next couple of years.\nAre you still bullish on US?\nWhen I talk about the US I say never bet against it, these are the most resilient people in the world.\nWe have an amazing gene pool a collection of people from all over the world who came not to exploit but to find a new way to grow and develop, many of them were running away from poverty and oppression.\nThey could see hope here those that came. It took enormous courage for people to get up and leave in the first place.\nI\u2019m an absolute optimist; my own journey proves it from a small farm in Iowa to the presidency of Coca-Cola.\nWho do you consider inspirational figures?\nFather Ted Hesburgh at Notre Dame. He is an absolute inspiration; still a simple priest. His most important moment in his life is when he says Mass.\nI took him to Latin America once. We called on several heads of state. The minute I brought him in there they paid no attention to me. He spoke to them in Portuguese, Spanish and charmed them all.\nHe was an incredible visionary who served six presidents on issues such as civil rights and immigration and built one of the great universities. There were those who said a Catholic university could never reach the heights of academic excellence, but Father Hesburgh knew differently.\nWarren Buffet still tap dances to work every day. He has arranged to give all his wealth away, but he\u2019d be rich in every important way with or without it.\nHe lives a very simple life. We have been friends for decades. I lived across the street from him in Omaha many years ago and he still lives there, in a modest house, like the man.\nOutside of my own father, of the people I have worked with Warren Buffett stands out. He is a learning machine, a great philanthropist. He has kept an", "baseline_completion": "amazing sense of humility.\nWhat is the best life lesson you have learned?\nThe life lesson I have learned is that wealth has nothing to do with money. It has to do with family, with friendships, with knowing and learning from interesting people, people who make a difference. If I didn\u2019t have ten dollars I\u2019d consider myself one of the wealthiest people in the world with the friends and family I have had.\nI say to my grandkids, you need to be an interesting person, and not just learn how to move your thumbs around an iPhone or iPad. No one wants to be around uninteresting people I tell them. Young people today don\u2019t want to be vulnerable. They want to be cool, the worst possible thing to be.\nI tell them you need to go through life saying this is who I am comfortable in my skin, for better or worse. Take me for what I am.", "orig_sample_length": 2714, "prompt_length": 2514, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "integrity and a focus on people despite his wealth.\nI want to be like that.

I\u2019ve always said I want to be his age, I\u2019d like to have his wealth, but I\u2019d like to have his integrity.\nOther than my father, I think Warren Buffett would be the greatest influence on me. He is a man of integrity and humility. He is the most generous man I know.\nWhat advice would you give to young Irish emigrants?\nI always say to young people in America, \u201cIf you want to make a difference in the world get a job and get rich, and then you can change the world.\u201d There is nothing more powerful than money in the world.\nYou can do more with it than anything else.

His knowledge of the humanities is very broad. He still loves being around people. He is the most humble and kind man you have ever met. He doesn\u2019t care what his net worth is. He has a tremendous sense of humour.

The official demand is the unconditional release of the 14 US soldiers and one Navy personnel being held captive by the Taliban.", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 191, "spike_entropies": [0.703087329864502, 0.6630706787109375, 0.5964112281799316, 0.5515570044517517, 0.9009941816329956, 0.3519429564476013, 0.36169353127479553, 0.5479910373687744, 0.5915551781654358, 0.6872420310974121, 0.7728750109672546, 0.5416660308837891, 0.417948454618454, 0.37652787566185, 0.42769333720207214, 0.3527265787124634, 0.357058048248291, 0.36261212825775146, 0.3539893627166748, 0.5897274017333984, 0.5387023091316223, 0.8994828462600708, 0.8635358214378357, 0.4029868245124817, 0.7785292863845825, 0.8824610114097595, 0.9043572545051575, 0.35368308424949646, 0.9622609615325928, 0.351628839969635, 0.8291832208633423, 0.9233280420303345, 0.8886839151382446, 0.6894609332084656, 0.6043716073036194, 0.5073174238204956, 0.5202695727348328, 0.9177455902099609, 0.5096895098686218, 0.5104694366455078, 0.6178748607635498, 0.85776686668396, 0.7376431226730347, 0.5307956337928772, 0.8878200054168701, 0.7265564203262329, 0.5722967386245728, 0.5413663983345032, 0.4521155059337616, 0.6728178262710571, 0.9267973899841309, 0.6305426359176636, 0.712806761264801, 0.35282695293426514, 0.37406954169273376, 0.35369783639907837, 0.8714731931686401, 0.47730588912963867, 0.359607070684433, 0.6583143472671509, 0.3517243266105652, 0.3714589476585388, 0.8825652599334717, 0.759069561958313, 0.7552764415740967, 0.35876861214637756, 0.6538295149803162, 0.6523356437683105, 0.912232518196106, 0.8765489459037781, 0.35450801253318787, 0.804135799407959, 0.7594964504241943, 0.39219170808792114, 0.7770541310310364, 0.35198211669921875, 0.7042384147644043, 0.878889799118042, 0.6711151599884033, 0.8213248252868652, 0.6905332207679749, 0.3631440997123718, 0.35396525263786316, 0.3518275320529938, 0.3607509732246399, 0.3517555892467499, 0.49895530939102173, 0.6012150049209595, 0.5949796438217163, 0.36305850744247437, 0.5726932883262634, 0.5619639158248901, 0.8983521461486816, 0.3591690957546234, 0.3517126142978668, 0.375410258769989, 0.8582682609558105, 0.8470423221588135, 0.9179031252861023, 0.8398257493972778, 0.6111940741539001, 0.3534386456012726, 0.3521518111228943, 0.7994856834411621, 0.8489820957183838, 0.908065915107727, 0.5049279928207397, 0.3522432744503021, 0.3518591821193695, 0.6055638790130615, 0.3515389859676361, 0.7638627290725708, 0.3535807430744171, 0.8271430730819702, 0.7104431986808777, 0.3560977578163147, 0.9357799887657166, 0.504784107208252, 0.7000634670257568, 0.35273459553718567, 0.5077083706855774, 0.36315295100212097, 0.35294419527053833, 0.6204584836959839, 0.4906894266605377, 0.6242309808731079, 0.45644426345825195, 0.3951303958892822, 0.3533267676830292, 0.49867984652519226, 0.8110849261283875, 0.8906633257865906, 0.8957549333572388, 0.8402442932128906, 0.8460252285003662, 0.8928775787353516, 0.35292425751686096, 0.43009835481643677, 0.7568316459655762, 0.7581350803375244, 0.353934109210968, 0.3526783585548401, 0.9045591354370117, 0.452579140663147, 0.7856185436248779, 0.933612585067749, 0.36713966727256775, 0.6170651912689209, 0.7612404227256775, 0.4775981903076172, 0.5607162117958069, 0.6426256895065308, 0.38135647773742676, 0.8190146684646606, 0.8336690664291382, 0.5206540822982788, 0.8250531554222107, 0.7018680572509766, 0.4217640459537506, 0.5575383305549622, 0.6585360765457153, 0.7740704417228699, 0.9349545240402222, 0.7598309516906738, 0.5709375143051147, 0.8091135025024414, 0.3900788426399231, 0.3622710108757019, 0.6313217282295227, 0.3616219162940979, 0.7835719585418701, 0.861720860004425, 0.717109739780426, 0.6052771806716919, 0.8824928402900696, 0.6577568054199219, 0.6343895792961121, 0.8951195478439331, 0.7927189469337463, 0.7504421472549438, 0.8007869720458984, 0.3754134178161621, 0.6644114851951599, 0.35969021916389465, 0.43049126863479614, 0.3755992650985718, 0.46613460779190063, 0.3533267080783844, 0.3521478772163391, 0.6552795767784119, 0.6684145927429199]}
{"idx": 337, "truncated_input": "SANOK, POLAND \u2014 In the far southeast corner of Poland, the warm summer air is resounding with the rasp of old-fashioned iron saws and the satisfying twack-twack-twack of ax blades on wood.\nHere, in the foothills of the Carpathians, an international crew of master timber craftsmen and students has been working on an intensely hands-on project that combines history, art and education. They are building a replica of the tall peaked roof and inner cupola of an ornate wooden synagogue that stood for 300 years in the town of Gwozdziec, now in Ukraine.\nThe replica, which will be 85 percent of the original size of the building, will be installed as one of the key components of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, currently under construction in Warsaw and scheduled to open in 2013.\nIts elaborate structure and the intricate painted decoration on the cupola ceiling will reproduce a form of architectural and artistic expression that was wiped out in World War II, when the Nazis put the torch to some 200 wooden synagogues in Eastern Europe. Many of them, like that in Gwozdziec, were centuries old and extraordinarily elaborate, with tiered roofs and richly decorative interior painting.\nThe Gwozdziec Synagogue, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, was a \u201ctruly resplendent synagogue that exemplified a high point in Jewish architectural art and religious painting,\u201d the architectural historian Thomas C. Hubka, an expert on the building, has written.\nConstructing the replica is a joint project of the museum in Warsaw and the Handshouse Studio, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that emphasizes learning by building, particularly the reconstruction of historical structures and other objects.\nThe Browns conducted years of research on Eastern Europe\u2019s lost wooden synagogues before embarking on construction of the Gwozdziec replica in Sanok in May. They studied prewar photographs, drawings and other documentation, built models and made on-site investigations of wooden churches and other buildings still found in Poland and Ukraine.\nThere are also several impressive masonry synagogues within an easy drive of Sanok. The 18th-century synagogue in Lancut, now a museum, has beautifully restored interior painting and other decoration. One in Rymanow stood for decades as a ruin but has been partially rebuilt, with a tall peaked roof now protecting the vigorous but sadly fading frescoes of Biblical animals and Jerusalem that grace its walls.\nIn Lesko, the 17th-century synagogue was rebuilt in the 1960s and today houses a gallery of local arts and crafts. Lesko\u2019s vast Jewish cemetery, just a short walk away, is one of the oldest in Poland, with massive tombstones dating to the 16th century.\nFor the Gwozdziec project, an international team of nearly 30 master craftsmen from the Timber Framers Guild are being joined by groups of students from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where the Browns teach.\nTimber framers came from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Belgium and Japan to lend their skills, all on a volunteer basis.\nAll the work is being carried out using techniques and tools that the builders of the original synagogue would have used: axes, saws, mallets and other hand-held implements. The aim is to gain an understanding of just what went into the building of the synagogue and how its construction would have been envisaged and carried out \u2014 and also to lend authenticity to the replica.\n\u201cIt brings back the lost story of the synagogue, the town, this culture,\u201d said Patrick Goguen, a student at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.\nThe project", "baseline_completion": "is occurring in several stages. Building the timber-framed roof and cupola is the first stage, running through June. Students and artists will hold workshops this summer and next summer to reproduce the intricate polychrome painting that adorned the ceiling of the cupola. These workshops will be held in eight Polish towns in masonry synagogues that still stand.\nThe timber framing is taking place in a corner of Sanok\u2019s Ethnographic Park, a sprawling open-air folk-architecture museum that displays wooden buildings \u2014 houses, barns, churches, chapels and even beehives \u2014 that have been transferred from a number of villages in the region.\nHere, thick logs are being hewn by hand into flat-sided timbers \u2014 a process that can take two days per log \u2014 and then manually sawed into thinner pieces. The components are then shaped and joined without nails.", "orig_sample_length": 1085, "prompt_length": 885, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "in Sanok is the first time in 30 years that the Browns have returned to the country where they spent four years working with master craftsmen on the rebuilding of old churches.\nIt is also the first time that they have undertaken a replica of an architectural structure. The project started in March with a tour of the site in Gwozdziec, the construction of models of the synagogue and the outlining of a detailed plan for the Sanok replica.\nThe Gwozdziec replica, which will have a footprint of 32 by 24 feet (about 10 by 7.5 meters), will be constructed in a tiny courtyard of the museum in Warsaw, where it will be assembled in sections and eventually painted.", "w_wm_output": "is a continuation of what the Timber Framers Guild calls a \u201cBuilding a Living Legacy\u201d program, which it began in 2004. In Canada, the guild recreated a steam-powered sawmill. In the U.S., it built a barn at a historic farm near Brattleboro, Vt., and a 1754 New England meetinghouse in Shaftsbury, Vt.\nThe on-site construction of the replica began in mid-May with the erection of a temporary frame.

{"idx": 339, "truncated_input": "The SNP's internal feud reached new depths of bitterness last night when party leader Alex Salmond was told by treasurer Ian Blackford to apologise for criticisms made last week or face being sued for defamation.\nAs moves continued to oust Mr Blackford, the party was also preparing disciplinary action against one of his closest allies, Ms Margo MacDonald, who faces accusations of breaking internal rules by publicly challenging a parliamentary group decision.\nMs MacDonald, a critic of Mr Salmond's leadership style, will be dealt with on Thursday at a meeting which her supporters claim could mark the start of a campaign to have her deselected.\nNationalist spokesmen desperately sought to play down the effects of the furious row which erupted between Mr Salmond and Mr Blackford last week over reports that the SNP was in deep financial trouble.\nPress officer Kevin Pringle refused to give details of the behind-the-scenes leadership attack on Mr Blackford at the weekend party executive meeting which passed a motion of no confidence in him by 18 votes to three.\nSNP rules allow the executive to admonish, suspend or expel a member - which some observers think could be the leadership's next move if Mr Blackford stays put.\nParty insiders have pointed privately to Mr Blackford as the source of recent stories about the SNP's financial state. Mr Blackford has hotly denied any wrongdoing. The cause of the row is Mr Blackford's reputedly hard line as treasurer in drawing up tough housekeeping rules for the party which is in debt.\nHe is thought privately to believe Mr Salmond and former chief executive Michael Russell, together spent irresponsibly during the Scottish Parliament elections and then left him to clear up the financial mess. Mr Blackford has repeatedly said that as a prominent and wealthy banker in Edinburgh he must ensure his conduct is above reproach because his professional reputation is on the line.\nThe latest dispute between the leader and treasurer involves the extent of the party's overdraft and the effectiveness of Mr Blackford's efforts to have it cleared before the General Election.\nHe and Mr Salmond were involved in an acrimonious dispute last summer after The Herald revealed that Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter had made a major contribution - said to be about #200,000 - to the SNP but had not been named as the source. Rules at the time did not require the identity of major donors to be revealed but parties had agreed to abide by the spirit of the new procedures.\nMr Blackford irritated Mr Salmond, who claimed the SNP had behaved perfectly properly, with his insistence that there must be no ''jiggery pokery''.\nRelations between the two men have never recovered and hit a new low last week with newspaper claims that the SNP was broke and had been forced to sell its Edinburgh HQ to help pay off an overdraft believed to be #400,000.\nIn fact, the SNP had planned long ago to sell its offices. The party is believed to have struck an agreement on the sale last week and it must now find a new headquarters.\nProceeds from the sale are not expected to be used in clearing the overdraft which deputy party leader John Swinney predicted last month would be paid off around the end of this year and which was about #600,000 at its worst.\nMr Blackford, who is reputedly wealthy, told Radio Clyde that when he was involved in talks with his bank about personally helping the SNP out of its financial difficulty, Mr Salmond was encouraging former party leader Willie Wolfe to run against him as treasurer. Mr Wolfe subsequently withdrew. ''I don't need lessons from Alex Salmond on integrity or trust,'' Mr Blackford said.\nThe SNP would not confirm a report that Mr Salmond accused Mr Blackford of incompetence and of destabilising the party and had appeared to blame him for the overspend.\nHe rejected suggestions that he and allies like Ms MacDonald were being purged as an offensive against dissidents. ''I don't believe in", "baseline_completion": "conspiracy theories,'' he said.\nMr Blackford pointed out that his treasurer's report to the national council last month had been accepted without questioning.\nMs MacDonald incurred the wrath of the leadership when she complained publicly about the parliamentary party's refusal to set aside SNP debating time in the chamber for her ideas for exploring the use of cannabis, particularly as an aid to those suffering pain. She accused some of her colleagues of ''reneging'' on the issue.\nbetween the leader and treasurer.\nLabour revelled in the SNP disarray. Scotland Office Minister Brian Wilson said: ''Alex Salmond's control freak tendencies have finally come home to roost. Having ousted the party treasurer in the night of the long sgian dubhs he has now turned his sights on the independence-minded Margo MacDonald.", "orig_sample_length": 1143, "prompt_length": 943, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the politics of exclusion, I believe in the politics of inclusion,'' he said. ''The politics of inclusion say we're building a party which is representative of the people of Scotland.''\nBut Mr Pringle said Mr Salmond had been criticised by some members who felt that the SNP leader was not being honest with them about the state of the party's finances. ''He is not prepared to make any secret of the fact that the party is in financial difficulties,'' he said.\n''He is very clear about the fact that the recent difficulties resulted from a failure by the previous leadership to abide by the rules of the party.''\nMr Blackford spokesman Colin McArthur said: ''Ian Blackford will not apologise for being open and honest about the financial state of the party. He is a strong advocate of transparency.''\nHe said that the delay in selling the Edinburgh HQ was due", "w_wm_output": "the Soviet model of the Leninist party,'' he said.\nMs MacDonald, the longest serving Westminster MP after being elected in 1987, is a close ally of Mr Salmond's but she has become deeply disenchanted as she faces the end of her political career.\nShe was one of the most outspoken critics of the Scottish Parliament's internal disciplinary procedures which have led to the expulsion of three MPs.\nMs MacDonald was deemed to have broken party rules by ''making public statements on the internal business of the parliamentary group''.\nHer supporters argue the decision goes against the principles of democracy as it was made after a meeting was held on the basis that it would be a private discussion.\nMs MacDonald could face a ban on standing for the party at the next election, a point which her supporters have warned could mean she would have to seek",

{"idx": 341, "truncated_input": "Quite frankly, thoughts and prayers can only go so far. They have limited ability to protect our families. The time has come for our elected leaders \u2013 including President Barack Obama \u2013 to stand up and fight for our families and children, and their safety.\nBut the American people support stronger gun safety measures more than he believes or cares to say. Polls now demonstrate this to be true.\nWhen our children are being shot at and killed in their schools, or movie theaters, we have to take meaningful action. These tragedies are too frequent, and are, as the president said, heartbreaking.\nWe need to talk about gun laws. We need an open and honest debate about the tragedies happening in our communities, one after another. There are common-sense laws that can help prevent these tragedies, and Americans support them.\nThe \u201cFix Gun Checks Act,\u201d if passed, would make it tougher for the mentally ill to legally buy guns by strengthening background checks so people like James Holmes (the Aurora shooter) can\u2019t acquire guns. Ninety percent of Americans want to fix gaps in government databases that allow the mentally ill or drug users from buying guns. Even gun owners support the laws.\nEighty-two percent of gun owners (National Rifle Association and non-NRA members) believe that a criminal background check should be required for anyone purchasing a gun, according to data released by Republican pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns earlier this year, 76 percent of gun owners support prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns, 80 percent support mandatory gun safety training for anyone applying for a concealed permit, and 78 percent of gun owners believe that concealed permits should only be granted to applicants who have not committed violent misdemeanors.\nThe NRA, which fights against all this, is out of touch \u2014 even with its own membership. Its power to dictate this debate has to be challenged.\nThe data on assault weapons is just as telling. The man identified Friday as the gunman, Adam Lanza was armed with semiautomatic pistols and a semiautomatic rifle and the killers in Aurora and Portland both used an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle. Sixty-three percent of Americans said they favor a nationwide ban on assault weapons, according to a 2011 CBS/New York Times poll, and 63 percent favored banning high-capacity magazines that hold many rounds of ammunition.\nWe found, in a 2011 survey we conducted for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, that 57 percent of Americans support a law that would limit the size of ammunition clips so that the gun could not fire more than 10 bullets without having to be reloaded. Only a third, or 34 percent, of Americans opposed that law.\nThe Brady Bill, which expired under President George W. Bush, and that Obama said he supported, regulated these kinds of assault weapons (AR-15). Those guns are now unregulated and the result is tragedy after tragedy that won\u2019t end until elected leaders step up.\nSupport for sounder, safer gun laws is not restricted to blue states or big urban cities. In a study conducted by Lake Research Partners earlier this year in swing state-senate districts in Virginia, we found that two-thirds of voters (65 percent) in a rural western Virginia district believe the gun laws should be made stronger \u2014 including 52 percent who strongly believe so. Just 24 percent say they should be less restrictive.\nNinety-two percent of voters in a state senate district centered in Roanoke, Virginia, strongly endorsed requiring background checks for people purchasing guns and permits for people who want to carry a concealed loaded weapon.\nThe NRA and those who oppose gun safety measures should welcome a gun-control debate \u2014 especially if they think they have the winning hand.\nThe consistent lack of leadership on this issue is stunning. But what is most unnerving is that it does not have to be this way \u2013 the American people support common sense gun laws.\nOthers have said, even on Friday, that now is not the time to discuss more gun laws. They said this same thing after Aurora, after Portland, and now after Newtown. They are trying to silence the millions of Americans who want stronger protections from gun violence in their communities.\nThese silencers, led by the NRA, continue to use the 2011 Gallup poll, which we have already explained is problematic, to shut down the debate about new gun laws that will make us safer. That poll said that 43 percent of Americans support stricter gun laws, a 6 percentage point drop from 2008.\nBut as the numbers we have cited here show, this single Gallup question is too shallow to really tell the story of what Americans think about gun safety measures.\nNow is the time to have a discussion about gun laws that will make our communities and families safer. The American people are ready.\nObama showed great courage earlier this year when he stood up for the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry. His courage and leadership is needed here too. These tragedies will happen again and again until our leaders stand up and pass meaningful gun-safety laws that the American public supports.\nNo, the public doesn\u2019t agree.\nThe majority of Americans support the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. This is a fact.\nThe public does not agree. The only reason there were so many deaths is because the federal ban on firearms within 100feet of a school does not permit a responsible citizen from carrying a firearm. Otherwise someone would have dropped this Perp in his tracks. The police and your gov\u2019t can\u2019t be everywhere and make you safe. Grow up and start taking responsibility for your own security. This article represents the psychology of the victim.\nThe Republicans need any and all fringe groups to make up for the fact that they represent a small percentage of the electorate.\nTheir greatest fear is that people will figure them out.\nWhich public is this that you speak of? The 26% as usual? Stop using tragedy to push your BS agendas.\nAlmost every Swiss man has an assault rifle and its ammunition, at home, as part of his obligation to do military service. Yet killings using these rifles are extremely rare. Why?\nThe two writers of this \u201copinion piece\u201d (you noted, I didn\u2019t call it news, nor refer to the authors as journalists), have managed to present about as much political drivel and spin as I\u2019ve ever seen, in one single story. The vast majority of the article is composed of opinion, half truths, and highly targeted, and vague opinion \u201cpolls\u201d. PULEEZE, can we get some real journalism here?\nA species that eats its young or fails to protect them becomes extinct. Think about it.\n@saildog07. You are clearly remarkably ignorant of what the US is, what we face as a people and what \u201cinalienable rights\u201d means.\nI think we should ban meth and heroin, that would keep it off the streets and, keep people from doing it.\nThe Colordao theater killer chose the only movie theater within 20 miles that had a ban on concealed weapons. You want the only people in the world to have guns to be governments and criminals? a naive concept.\nThis guy was insane \u2013 lets address the problems with mental illness and get some security at schools for God\u2019s sake.\nFor the first time in my life, I am thinking about buying a gun.\nThe only places where these mass shootings have happened are where guns are not allowed. (Schools, churches, government buildings) These people maybe mentally ill but they still know enough to do this in places where someone can\u2019t shoot back at them. Anyplace that does not allow legal gun owners to carry a firearm should be required to have an armed guard 24/7. Even then the armed guard won\u2019t be in the right place at the right time. I would feel much safer sending my kids to the school in Texas with the Guardian program where some of the teachers are licensed to carry firearms. Outlaw firearms and only criminals will have them.\nThis is not what the public wants. This is what the liberals want for the public.\nI believe in gun control. I control mine very well. How about controlling the pez dispensing of mind altering, psychosis enducing drugs you\u2019re giving people. Even dispensing these harmful drugs to young adults!\nIn the Supreme Court case, Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748 (2005), the court ruled that our local police are not responsible for protecting us. SOOOOOO, who IS responsible for protecting us? We are responsible. That\u2019s why I responsibly conceal carry. I protect my wife and 2 small children. When more responsible people carry, violent crime goes down. The FBI crime statistics don\u2019t lie. Why do the left and gun grabbing crowd ignore this fact? Liberalism is a mental disorder.\nLets look one poll that this particular article is using for it\u2019s numbers.\nThe poll used 2 Senate Districts in the State of VA. District 21 and District 38.\nwith the total numbers of respondents being 305 voters in District 21 and 302 voters in district 38.\nThat\u2019s a fairly small sample size considering Roanoke VA (part of district 21) has a population of 92,376 (2010 numbers) but polls being what they are they can\u2019t call every registered voter.\nSo they are making a statement for the entire state of Virginia with a population of 8 million give or take from the words of 607 people. Now not all of the 8 million are old enough to vote or even care enough to vote. But the statement that such a small group of people are the norm for a much larger population is suspicious.\nLets now look at the generator of the poll and the authors of this piece. Lake Research here is a snippet from their web site.\nNothing unusual there, next check their \u201coutstanding clients\u201d I did not check all of them but the ones I did check are Democrats with a history of voting for more firearms laws or outright bans.\nSo going down to the list of causes that they have worked for I see several that catch my eye, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, MoveOn.org, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. So I think it is safe to say that this is a group that is defiantly not non-bias. Nothing wrong with that, but I would not trust this group to give me honest results any more than I would a Republican think tank on gay marriage.\nSo as to the title of this opinion piece states \u201cPublic agrees\u201d there is not enough data in their source material to even make that assumption let alone any reason to believe that the authors are trying to give anything but their own viewpoints legitimacy.\nI think the founding fathers would have had a different opinion if they realized that modern \u201cconstitutionalists\u201d were defending the right of 14 year old drug dealers to carry semiautomatic weapons or mentally deranged people to spray bullets into elementary school classrooms. The one part that is frequently lacking in these types of discussions is any realistic alternate solution or approach for stemming the regular occurrence of these types of events. Arming guards at the entrances to all schools?", "baseline_completion": "Really? Is that really the statement of our times? Ok, so we are the most heavily armed society in the world and we kill more fellow Americans every year than the combined total of the Gulf War, the Twin Towers assault, the Iraq war and the War on Terror in Afghanistan. Every year. Are there any serious suggestions of how to begin to address these murders?\nA gun is an inanimate tool not deviant behavior and crime is deviant behavior not an inanimate tool.\nYou can\u2019t prevent deviant behavior by regulating tools because tools are incapable of behavior and the number of tools available to the world\u2019s deviants is endless.\nEven if you could legislate guns out of existence, deviants could, would and have used other things that gave them a power advantage over their victims\u2014knives, clubs, rocks or even sharp sticks\u2014all of which are very legal and very accessible.", "orig_sample_length": 2854, "prompt_length": 2654, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Then you have as many people in the front entrance as you do in any other entrance, and there\u2019s still a back door. What about arming the teachers? What about arming the parents who pull into school parking lots? What about arming the 14 year old drug dealer who is robbing the store that sold him the drugs? The only way to solve a problem is to identify it and have a solution in place to counteract it. Unfortunately, the only solution that is currently in place is a lot of meaningless hand wringing and finger pointing.\nI am a libertarian. I believe in gun control. I don\u2019t believe in infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens. I do not believe that people who want guns should be allowed to have them. Period. Too many people believe that having guns is a right. It is not. It is a privilege. And it should be.\n", "w_wm_output": "Banning the sale of assault weapons to private citizens?

{"idx": 343, "truncated_input": "James finished the preseason ranked tied for 14th in scoring (13.7 points per game) among league forwards.\nExhibition numbers mean little, or perhaps nothing, in the grand scheme of a season, but Bosh\u2019s statistical effort during the preseason is anything but irrelevant \u2014 or random \u2014 when taken in the correct context. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spent the entire training camp drilling his players on the idea of a free-flowing, equal-opportunity offense. That Bosh, Mr. Random Guy, emerged from training camp as the team\u2019s leading scorer means the Heat\u2019s offense is healthy heading into the season opener against the Celtics on Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nMore often than not, Bosh is open on the offensive end. The ball found him during the preseason, and Bosh\u2019s skills did the rest. He led the Heat in field-goal percentage (.551) while also leading the team in rebounds (43).\nJames is the driving force behind Spoelstra\u2019s idea of \u201cpositionless basketball,\u201d but Bosh might be the second-most important cog in the wheel. On most nights, Bosh is the quickest big man on the floor, and his consistent jump shot allows him to stretch defenses.\nConventional defensive strategy against the Heat calls for packing the paint to account for Wade and James. Entering his third season with the Heat, Bosh knows where to find the open spots on the periphery. He likes to call those opportunities random, but, when paired with James, the results are more like basketball jazz.\n\u201cHe\u2019s open,\u201d said James, who led the Heat with 41 assists in the preseason. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot more pace and a lot more space for him, and giving him a lot more opportunities to go at his matchup.\nWade credits Bosh\u2019s big preseason to his work before training camp. Bosh skipped the Olympics to fully heal from the abdominal injury he sustained in the playoffs. Upon his return, he met with Wade and James and vowed to carry more of the load early in the season.\nWhen Bosh first arrived in Miami, the Heat wanted him to pack on muscle mass and bulk up for a life in the paint. Spoelstra scrapped that plan after the playoffs when the Heat used an unconventional lineup to win its second NBA championship. The Heat\u2019s coach instructed Bosh to focus on his natural skill set: speed, quickness and shooting.\nBosh averaged 18.0 points per game last season, but Wade says Bos", "baseline_completion": "h is capable of \u201cgoing for 20-plus a game and probably more effortlessly than\u201d himself and James.\nWhile Bosh has accepted the label of center, offensively he\u2019s more of a hybrid power forward than anything. The position of a traditional center is a dying art in the NBA, so much so that the league has removed the designation from All-Star ballots this season.\nFans will now vote for three \u201cfrontcourt players\u201d and two guards rather than two guards, two forwards and a center. Despite the change, Bosh still doesn\u2019t expect to garner any more votes for a starting spot.\n\u2022 The Heat finalized its 15-man roster on Saturday, cutting point guard Garrett Temple. Miami begins the season with 12 players from its championship team. Forward Rashard Lewis, forward Josh Harrellson and guard Ray Allen are the new additions.", "orig_sample_length": 805, "prompt_length": 605, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "h\u2019s new role will result in a more well-rounded Bosh.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be able to take on more defensive challenges and rebounding challenges,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI think he can also do more of the pick-and-roll and make the pass as the roll man, and that\u2019s something he\u2019s needed to do more of this season.\nAsked what he\u2019s most excited about during the season, Bosh said he can\u2019t wait to see how the Heat\u2019s core of Wade, James and himself can play together.\nOn Saturday, when the Heat hosts the Brooklyn Nets in its season opener, Bosh will be the third option. That\u2019s fine with him.", "w_wm_output": "h still isn\u2019t doing everything needed for a title-caliber team.\nAfter the Heat won the 2012 championship, Bosh was the only player on the roster who wasn\u2019t a member of the 2006 title team.

It's also important that the College Board understands the challenges that our students face when", "no_wm_output_length": 116, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.5779102444648743, 0.7599735856056213, 0.6162161231040955, 0.9063400030136108, 0.7534953951835632, 0.8734209537506104, 0.5439931750297546, 0.9000867605209351, 0.7728455066680908, 0.7393105030059814, 0.782909631729126, 0.8293682336807251, 0.5410102605819702, 0.8127041459083557, 0.6334726810455322, 0.8776819109916687, 0.6024766564369202, 0.3516850769519806, 0.7102563381195068, 0.35196101665496826, 0.6736210584640503, 0.7927486896514893, 0.5974372625350952, 0.35159778594970703, 0.8741496205329895, 0.6541281938552856, 0.9571252465248108, 0.7015805840492249, 0.9438450336456299, 0.9139901995658875, 0.6487101316452026, 0.5594579577445984, 0.7351419925689697, 0.8263212442398071, 0.8175241947174072, 0.7157771587371826, 0.7630881071090698, 0.6443532109260559, 0.3530184030532837, 0.7608171105384827, 0.6451537609100342, 0.5663350820541382, 0.9700522422790527, 0.8997302055358887, 0.35469648241996765, 0.7829678058624268, 0.8674409985542297, 0.9375275373458862, 0.6375329494476318, 0.5506229400634766, 0.8891745805740356, 0.8575396537780762, 0.39299413561820984, 0.7092454433441162, 0.3518241345882416, 0.9018597602844238, 0.38039857149124146, 0.916029691696167, 0.7589418888092041, 0.5984675884246826, 0.7242981195449829, 0.35241445899009705, 0.4721929132938385, 0.7919031977653503, 0.5194957256317139, 0.6036099195480347, 0.3566899597644806, 0.5614450573921204, 0.9016957879066467, 0.9057244062423706, 0.9676767587661743, 0.8998292684555054, 0.894443929195404, 0.8037387728691101, 0.7173847556114197, 0.8899127840995789, 0.6756749153137207, 0.7569998502731323, 0.8737776279449463, 0.3604796230792999, 0.7322381138801575, 0.5641492009162903, 0.617438018321991, 0.754345178604126, 0.7455401420593262, 0.6370567679405212, 0.8113399744033813, 0.837436854839325, 0.35732632875442505, 0.48590192198753357, 0.7362000942230225, 0.942196249961853, 0.9095420837402344, 0.9269818067550659, 0.3771243691444397, 0.7082625031471252, 0.9262664914131165, 0.3527713418006897, 0.6474971175193787, 0.89854896068573, 0.3920266330242157, 0.8621957302093506, 0.7958000898361206, 0.8029567003250122, 0.35226449370384216, 0.5138263702392578, 0.9290083050727844, 0.8940728902816772, 0.9322587251663208, 0.35162901878356934, 0.920646071434021, 0.3693346381187439, 0.7564122080802917, 0.3515152633190155, 0.973278284072876, 0.9103233814239502, 0.682870626449585, 0.3515906035900116, 0.780633807182312, 0.35605284571647644, 0.3875015079975128, 0.3851940631866455, 0.7838007807731628, 0.7052688598632812, 0.4868459105491638, 0.8848185539245605, 0.7715416550636292, 0.8835135698318481, 0.8012676239013672, 0.4248880445957184, 0.8154100775718689, 0.3515077531337738, 0.9281036853790283, 0.8593637347221375, 0.8565371036529541, 0.8571838736534119, 0.8532626628875732, 0.35536548495292664, 0.37904566526412964, 0.8247674703598022, 0.6391360759735107, 0.3916589021682739, 0.7981494665145874, 0.4347679615020752, 0.3516266942024231, 0.3521777391433716, 0.6419059634208679, 0.8202093839645386, 0.7138264179229736, 0.8107227683067322, 0.49735701084136963, 0.5705204010009766, 0.8996486663818359, 0.9527375102043152, 0.7104333639144897, 0.3523011803627014, 0.8926440477371216, 0.6474740505218506, 0.8669278025627136, 0.8476184606552124, 0.35782864689826965, 0.9531023502349854, 0.5866291522979736, 0.6933032274246216, 0.9562872648239136, 0.3574560880661011, 0.8598943948745728, 0.9217749834060669, 0.7440874576568604, 0.8136160969734192, 0.9386811256408691, 0.7538590431213379, 0.5531399250030518, 0.6955585479736328, 0.8029924631118774, 0.5562097430229187, 0.8270483016967773, 0.781983494758606, 0.6076396703720093, 0.4479689598083496, 0.6789441704750061, 0.8630116581916809, 0.6861938238143921, 0.3523770868778229, 0.8686630725860596, 0.53664630651474, 0.553213894367218, 0.7298736572265625, 0.4736497104167938, 0.35352858901023865, 0.692333459854126, 0.4579771161079407, 0.6627780795097351, 0.9129647612571716, 0.35276633501052856, 0.7060190439224243, 0.7421244382858276, 0.6316935420036316, 0.6401926875114441, 0.8164454698562622]}

Now a member of the state legislature, Rep. Tina Bojanowski (D) is supporting a bill to prohibit corporal punishment.\n\u201cWhen someone is doing something wrong, the most important thing is to change their behavior. There are more effective measures to change students\u2019 behavior than striking them,\u201d Riley, a former high school principal, told The Washington Post.\nThere\u2019s been a national downward trend in corporal punishment in schools, according to research by Kids Count Data Center. In 2016, the Obama administration called for an end to the practice in all states and school districts. Thirty-one states have barred the practice, but 19 still permit it, Riley said.\nIn Kentucky, 17 school districts permit corporal punishment. According to research done by the Kids Count Data Center, during the 2017-2018 academic year, there were 452 reported instances of such punishment in the state.\nOf those 17 districts, five accounted for 85 percent of cases. Bell County reported 129 incidents, the highest in Kentucky for the academic year.

Similar bills were also introduced in 2017 and 2018 but not passed.\nThe Kentucky school districts that permit paddling are predominantly in rural areas, according to Riley. Their legislators who oppose the bill argue they want to protect against government overreach. \u201cThey say that discipline should be left to local school board, not state government,\u201d Riley said.\nWith eight days left in the legislative session, Riley said, H.B. 202 is unlikely to be voted on imminently.

She said she was not fond of the practice and wants to end it.\n\u201cI think there is a difference between punishment for wrongdoing and the use of force in order to gain compliance,\u201d she said.\nBojanowski said she first learned about the practice when she met with families as a Democratic candidate for the Kentucky House in 2017.\nAfter the meeting, a father told her that he had given his then-13-year-old son two licks with a paddle when he refused to go to school.\n\u201cCorporal", "w_wm_output": "to a request for comment.\nSchool officials in Kentucky could not be reached Monday, and the Kentucky Department of Education said in a statement to The Washington Post that it was \u201cunable to comment on pending legislation.\u201d\nBojanowski grew up in the Jefferson County schools, which at the time were among the most segregated in the South.

{"idx": 347, "truncated_input": "Lookout Landing jots down a few thoughts on Shoppach as only they can. Marc W over at USS Mariner take s a look at catching defense and trying to measure it.\nFor me, there aren't many ways to statistically measure catching defense. And of those ways -- throwing out runners, passed balls (don't you ever use catcher's ERA, ever) - that's about 1/10th of the responsibilities of the position. And because of that, any stat - namely Win Above Replacement player (WAR) - that uses a defensive metric is kind of flawed when it comes to catchers. So much of a catcher's responsibility cannot be measured or quantified with numbers. I was converted to catcher in college (ate my way out of second base), and played the position for three years. The amount of things that went into just one game were overwhelming - and that was at the NAIA level. So at the big league level? It's ridiculous. It's why I kind of just shrugged my shoulders on WAR comparisons of John Jaso and Mike Morse.\nOne thing that would be interesting is the 40-man roster move the Mariners would make if they sign Shoppach. Who do they designate for assignment? Would it be another young player like Yoervis Medina, or would the Mariners part ways with Mike Carp, who seems to have no place on the team.\nAs for other free agents .... outfielder Michael Bourn met with the Mets (see what I did there?). If you notice in the Sherman story, he views it as a long shot. Why? Well according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, Bourn's agent - Scott Boras - wants 5-years at $15 million per year. And if anyone knows what Boras wants, it would be Heyman.\nFrom what I've been told, there hasn't been a ton of discussion about Bourn in the Mariners' front office. I'm guessing the idea of $75 million is a little too much of a commitment, particularly with their push to sign Felix Hernandez to a contract extension. Of course, that could change if the asking price", "baseline_completion": "went down a little. But how often does Boras' asking price go down? Would Bourn help the Mariners? Yes. He would give them a legitimate lead-off hitter that they don't have and another defensive presence in the outfield. Having Bourn and Gutierrez in the same outfield could offset any defensive issues in left field. But I'd be surprised if they go this route. And it's not because they are worried about giving up their first round pick (No. 12 overall) as compensation.\nThe Mariners are still hoping to add a veteran pitcher as well. Joe Saunders' name has been mentioned outside sources, but it doesn't sound like the team is interested in overpaying. Lohse's asking price is also way too high for his value .... here's a list of other pitchers that are unsigned. Any names that interest you?", "orig_sample_length": 701, "prompt_length": 501, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "drops.\nIn the meantime, the Mariners continue to work on other areas of their roster. They've been trying to re-sign first baseman Kendrys Morales, who is currently a free agent. Morales has been a key contributor over the past two seasons, batting .283/.341/.512 with 46 doubles, 10 triples, 23 home runs and 90 RBI.\nI think Morales would fit well in Seattle's lineup, but I'm not sure he's worth that much money. I think he's looking for more than the Mariners are willing to offer, and I'm not sure why he'd want to return.\nThe Mariners have also been trying to sign starting pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma, and according to a report from JPWarriorGamin, contact with his", "w_wm_output": "drops, but as it stands now, the Mariners seem a little more interested in upgrading center field, and Bourn's price tag could scare them off.\nLabels: catchers who can't hit but throw out a few guys here and there, free agent season, raul iba\u00f1ez, steve delabar, the 40 man roster, the catcher's position\nMike S.

{"idx": 351, "truncated_input": "HANOI, Vietnam \u2013 Vietnam&apos;s government has vowed to crack down on three dissident blogs, a move that appeared to backfire Thursday as record numbers of people visited the sites and the bloggers pledged to keep up their struggle for freedom of expression.\nPrime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung&apos;s order for police to arrest those responsible for the websites reflects growing unease within the Communist Party over the emergence of blogs and social media accounts that publish dissenting views, independent reporting and whistleblowing. The party doesn&apos;t allow free media, and fears criticism or discussion of its failings on the Internet could lead to social instability and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 loss of its power.\n\"Nobody can shut our mouth or stop our freedom of expression,\" said a member of the team that administers one of the targeted blogs, Danlambao. \"This is our mission. We will continue at any cost.\" The blogger chatted over the Internet with The Associated Press on the condition that his name and exact location not be published because of the risk of arrest.\nDanlambao, or \"Citizens&apos; Journalism,\" is one of the most prominent of several dissident blogs that have sprung up in the last two years.\nIt has attracted thousands of viewers in recent weeks because of its reporting on suspected power struggles among the ruling elite that it says may have been behind the arrest of a banking tycoon last month. It has speculated that the detention of Nguyen Duc Kien, said to be close to the prime minister&apos;s daughter, was the result of tensions between the premier and the president.\nLate Wednesday, the government said Danlambao and two others sites had been \"publishing distorted and fabricated articles\" against the leadership. It said that Vietnamese state employees were forbidden from visiting the sites.\nIt is not illegal for Vietnamese to visit the targeted sites, but they are blocked by the government&apos;s firewall. Vietnam blocks many sensitive websites, though the firewall is fairly easy to get around.\n\"This is a wicked plot of the hostile forces,\" a government statement said, adding that the prime minister had ordered police to arrest those associated with the sites.\nThe statement led to a surge in visitors to the sites as curious Vietnamese wanted to see what they had been publishing, according to the blogs.\nThe Danlambao blog said it was on course to have more than 500,000 page views Thursday, more than double its normal amount, thanks to what it called the unintended public relations coup handed to it by the government.\nOne of the other targeted sites, Quanlambao, or the \"Officials&apos; Journalism\" blog, said Dung&apos;s threat was meant to lay the legal groundwork for a campaign of arrests against bloggers.\nThe blogger contacted by The AP said Dung mentioned their site by name to try to scare contributors from contacting it.\n\"They (the government) are losing control of the independent blogs,\" the blogger said. \"Not just our one.\"\nThe blogger said Danlambao&apos;s sources of information were other bloggers, journalists who work for state", "baseline_completion": "-run media, ordinary citizens and Communist Party members seeking to damage other factions within the party. Some of the material comes from reading between the lines of reports in the state-run media, the blogger said.\n\"They provide us the bullets and we shoot \u2014 because they can&apos;t,\" the blogger said.\nInternational watchdog Reporters Without Borders says there are currently at least five journalists and 19 bloggers being held on various charges in Vietnam, part of a gathering government effort to stifle criticism over the last two years even as the country presses ahead with opening its economy to foreign investment. The government labels democracy and free speech activists as terrorists.\nJournalists working for foreign news organization are allowed to live in the country but must ask permission to report outside the capital.

The blog said it would continue to publish, despite the government&apos;s warning.\n\"We are not afraid of the reprisal of the dictatorship,\" the blog said.\nThe government has not specified what it considers distorted or fabricated.

{"idx": 356, "truncated_input": "The Sri Lanka Women\u2019s sevens Rugby team lost a possible Bronze medal by not participating at the 18th Asian Games rugby sevens held from August 30-September 1 in Jakarta, Indonesia.\nAccording to reliable sources, the rugby administrators were unable to convince the Sports Ministry and the NOC when initial discussions took place for selections of teams and individual events.\nSources further revealed that no representative of the Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) attended the deciding meeting that may have otherwise had the opportunity for the women\u2019s rugby team to see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, it seemed that in a bid to absolve itself from the blunder and the chaotic situation, the SLR kept on stating that they are hoping to send the team but it never materialized.\nWhat was really baffling was the comment made to the media by one of the top ranked SLR officials, where he said: \u201cWhen it comes to such high profile tournaments, the Ministry of Sports is funding only the teams which have clear opportunity to secure a medal.\u201d Such a statement, it appears gives the impression that SLR was under-prepared.\nThe Women\u2019s Tuskers did reasonably well in the Asian 7\u2019s circuit in 2017 just a few months prior to the Asian Games under the watchful eyes of Sudath Sampath (Head Coach), Inthie Marikkar (Director, High Performance), and Dilan Zoysa (Trainer). Going by some of their performances of this tournament especially of Sri Lanka\u2019s losing margins to Hong Kong (5-10) and Kazakstan (0-12); and the fact that Sri Lanka beat Thailand (24-12 to win the Plate championship) who incidentally lost the bronze medal to Kazakhstan at Asian Games speaks volumes of Sri Lanka\u2019s bright chances. While Japan won the Gold, the Silver went to China. So the top four teams at the Asian Games finally stand as Japan, China, Kazakstan and Thailand. Where would Sri Lanka been placed had they participated?\nIt is indeed a very sad state of affairs why the SLR officials just could not do their home work to come out with a sound assessment. Surely, the authorities who are top administrators in their own rights (may not necessarily be well conversant in sports) would have possibly understood the prospect of a medal on a general analytical perspective.

In the overall assessment, it was the 4 x 400 men\u2019s relay team and Men\u2019s 7\u2019s rugby team did perform well to secure fourth place.

In fact, it is a very cheap sport. For example, a rugby team comprising of 15 players only requires 13 players and a coach. The 15th player is a reserve.\nThe game is played on artificial turf and not grass. That means the expenses are cut by half.\nSeven players are needed to play a game.

Millennials received this info gratefully; finally, a thing we were not responsible for, an errand we did not actually have to do. Unfortunately, this is wrong; in fact, everyone should get the flu shot.\nLast year\u2019s flu season was the worst in a decade, worse than the year of swine flu. Over 80,000 people died. There are many factors at work, but a big one that medical professionals attributed to the unusually high rate of deaths and infections was a drop in the rate of adults who bothered to get their shot \u2014 yes, those same people between the ages of 18 and 65 who \u201cdon\u2019t need\u201d it.\nTo think about vaccines as they affect each person individually is blinkered; sure, you don\u2019t want to get sick, but more than vaccines prevent individual illness, they prevent illnesses", "baseline_completion": "from spreading. We see this already with children in locations where it\u2019s trendy among parents to simply not get their kids vaccinated from preventable diseases like measles out of irrational fears; because of those parents, those diseases spread faster and people die more frequently. Epidemics happen because of new, wild, aggressive disease strains, but they also happen for lack of prevention. More to the point, just because you can afford to miss work or buy medication when you get sick doesn\u2019t mean others can.\nIn the same way you don\u2019t not vote because nothing is bothering you specifically, you don\u2019t not get the flu shot because you are very likely to survive it yourself.

They also study how well the vaccine performs in different populations and adjust the strains accordingly.\nThe flu shot doesn\u2019t actually need to provide perfect protection against all strains to be effective.\n\u201cSince the vaccine is not always 100% effective in preventing influenza infection, it is important to get vaccinated even if there is a chance the vaccine will not completely protect", "w_wm_output": "being spread. As the New York Times reports, even if you\u2019re not at risk of dying, you can still get other people sick. If you get the flu shot, and you still get the flu, you\u2019re a lot more likely not to pass it on, and also a lot more likely not to have the complications from the flu such as bacterial infections or pneumonia, which may be fatal.\nSo even if you\u2019re not at risk of dying, you can still get other people sick.

{"idx": 359, "truncated_input": "\"I wanted to retire,\" he said. \"That's what I wanted to do.\n\"That was definitely on my mind. It was there.\"\nHow seriously was he considering it? Opara says he isn't quite so sure.\nBut a long injury history \u2014 and a look toward life after soccer \u2014 made it more than just a hasty reaction. He played only three games in 2014 before suffering a rare chondral defect in his right ankle.\n\"I've been through a lot with all the other injuries,\" he said. \"I wanted to be healthy for my life.\n\"And I felt like I couldn't catch a break. It was like, this again? I just wondered if it would be worth it to go through all that all over again.\"\nOpara spoke with his family and friends. He told them he was contemplating retirement \u2014 only two months after his 26th birthday and only days after national experts put him in the conversation for Major League Soccer's best defender.\nThen? A change of heart.\nIt came slowly. After undergoing a minimally-invasive surgery \u2014 a recently-developed procedure designed to expedite his return to the field \u2014 Opara learned his season wasn't over just yet. Doctors allowed for the possibility of a 2015 return. Maybe.\nA possibility is all he needed. He began rehab in the following weeks. The pain subsided more quickly than he expected. He regained the urge to join his teammates back on the field.\nAnd that's looking more and more likely by the day. Opara has returned to Sporting Kansas City practice, at least for the non-contact drills, with an eye toward returning to the field this season. His coach, Peter Vermes, expects it to happen \u2014 whether it be before the regular season concludes on Oct. 25 or sometime during the playoffs.\n\"That's always been the goal (since the diagnosis),\" Opara said. \"Obviously the way I've been progressing, for now, why not try to push and see where it goes? If we keep doing well as a team and hopefully make the playoffs and make a deep run, I see no reason why I wouldn't be available for that.\"\nThere are still hurdles to cross, of course. While Opara says his lateral movement is \"just as good, if not better\" than it was prior to the Achilles' tendon rupture, the linear movements are still a work in progress. He is noted for his athleticism \u2014 which makes him a dangerous aerial weapon \u2014 but his jumping ability hasn't fully returned yet.\nThere are signs it's close.\n\"Ike was in an exercise the other day. If you would've come out here and you didn't know the team, and I (told) you to pick that guy that you think is", "baseline_completion": "injured out there, you would never pick him,\" Vermes said. \"I can tell you that.\"\nEven so, Opara isn't near 90-minutes fit. And central defender isn't a typical spot for a mid-gme substitution, though Vermes hinted at an exception.\n\"One of the things you can do with Ike is bring him on late in the game, and he can be an extra guy for aerial duels and things like that,\" Vermes said. \"He has value in that respect.\"\nIt's an exciting possibility \u2014 and a potentially significant one for a Sporting KC team in need of an added aerial threat on offensive set pieces.\n\"I don't know what my future holds. I'm just taking it day-by-day,\" Opara said. \"But it looks a lot better than it did a few months ago. I know that.\"", "orig_sample_length": 845, "prompt_length": 645, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the best athlete on the team, you're going to pick Ike. You pick him,\" Vermes told reporters earlier this week. \"Ike is a monster. He's a beast. He's a monster athlete and he's a terrific player.\"\nAsked if he believes Opara can return for the playoffs, Vermes said, \"Yeah, I do. I do. I'm very confident in him.\"\nOpara, though, is not yet ready to make a promise. He's still in the process of easing back into things. He's still unsure of his exact timetable.\nBut that's OK for now. He's back in Kansas City. He's getting stronger. And he's feeling better.\nThe decision to stay is no longer a difficult one.\n\"It's definitely a big relief,\" Opara", "w_wm_output": "the most athletic on the field, you would've picked Ike,\" Vermes said. \"You look at his jump and how he's moving, and it's just as good as it was when he was here. He just hasn't done the amount of running yet to get it back.\n\"His lateral explosiveness is the same. He's still the same guy.

{"idx": 364, "truncated_input": "Let\u2019s try again: what happened to the stock market yesterday? We still don\u2019t know, but it appears that something concrete happened against the background of a market that was already tripwire nervous over Greece and the euro and China and whatnot.\nConsidering that the giant decline happened on pretty much *no* volume, I think other factors are at work. I believe the core problem here was a real order imbalance with lots of volume (which took us down the original 350), then nyse halts these stocks, the market orders get rereouted (regnms and all) to ECN\u2019s where there is much less liquidity, and what liquidity is normally there is mostly provided by the nefarious HF strats who were rightly scaling back risk. So the 10K shares that might have been a downtick on nyse blows throught the BATS book completely.\nIn English, this means that when trading started to get too hot and heavy, the New York Stock Exchange stepped in to slow things down. In the old days, this would have worked, but not anymore. Most trading of NYSE stocks doesn\u2019t actually happen on the NYSE anymore, it happens on electronic communication networks (ECNs) like BATS in Kansas City, which is the third-largest stock exchange", "baseline_completion": "in the world. So what the algo guy is saying is that when the NYSE tried to slow things down, the computers responsible for program trading just switched their orders over to ECNs. Unfortunately, ECNs are largely used by high-frequency trading shops, and the HFT guys closed up when the market went kablooey. So the ECNs had no buyers, and even a small sell order could blow the doors off a stock price. Which it did.\nI\u2019m very much in favor of this. Maybe someday we\u2019ll understand all this stuff well enough to control it, but right now we don\u2019t seem to. Our financial system really needs a little bit of sand in the gears to bring it back down to human speeds. This would be a good way to do it, and would probably have other benefits too (quite aside from the money it raises).

Yesterday, the NYSE halted trading in a bunch of stocks, but the trading was already happening on the ECNs, so the trading just kept going.\nI\u2019ll leave it to the financial bloggers to parse the implications of this, but it looks to me like the NYSE was being a bit overzealous.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the NYSE halted trading in a bunch of stocks that were down around 350-400 points at the time. I\u2019ll be back later with a chart to see if this is a bullish sign.\nHat tip to Barry Ritholtz for the best explanation of the NYSE\u2019s actions yesterday.\nThis entry was posted in Economic theory and policy, Market Commentary and tagged ECN, New York Stock Exchange by Alex Knapp. Bookmark the permalink.\nW", "w_wm_output": "in the world.\nIn the world of electronic trading, the only thing worse than being on the wrong side of a stock price change is being on the wrong side of a stock price change in the middle of a stock price change. That\u2019s because price changes happen in a series of bursts as big buyers or big sellers try to dump stock, and the bursts get wider the farther from the center you get. So the further you are from the center, the worse you can get hit.\nIt\u2019s hard to say what caused the big move in stock prices in the first place, but a good start would be a look at who was trading at the time. According to a company called Nanex, one electronic trading firm, Citadel, was trading heavily at the time of the plunge. So was a hedge fund called D.E. Shaw. D.E.

{"idx": 366, "truncated_input": "KARACHI: Driving up to Landhi you reach an area on the rather bumpy Mehran Highway where pick-ups and lorries number more than the other vehicles. Those coming in are empty but the ones driving out are loaded with dozens of silver milk canisters. Well, of course, why wouldn\u2019t they be? After all, this is Bhains Colony, the place the entire city gets its milk from.\nYou can pick up some moos coming from various directions. But there are hardly any cattle roaming about freely here or there. That\u2019s because they are all doing the work inside the dairy farms on either side of the road. The animals there eat and drink all day to stay healthy and be able to produce lots and lots of good quality milk.\n\u201cWe milk our buffaloes twice in 24 hours \u2014 at 4am and 4pm,\u201d says Imtiaz Ahmed, one of the staff supervisors at Shaukat Mukhtar Farms. There are some 450 buffaloes at the farm and almost all are lined up to enjoy their feed as the men milk them manually by hand.\n\u201cEating keeps them busy. So as they munch on their feed they stay in one place for us to be able to milk them,\u201d he says. To ensure that the dairy workers don\u2019t get kicked in the face by the buffaloes, they also lightly tie up their hind legs while milking them.\nAsked why they don\u2019t have pumps for milking, he explains that there are pumps too at several dairy farms in Bhains Colony, but at their farms they prefer to milk by hand. \u201cUsually, we use pumps to milk cows, not buffaloes. Cows give more milk, too. Pumps are good for milking in quantity. But cows\u2019 milk is thin while buffalo milk is thicker and richer,\u201d he explains.\nThe feed the animals eat has been specially designed and is highly nutritious to help them produce more milk. \u201cIt contains wheat, porridge, lentils, mustard, spinach greens, Malaysian palm oil, corn, ghee, etc,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy workers with stainless steel buckets and metal canisters bring over the milk they collect to pour into big metal tubs placed at various points. \u201cFresh milk is warm. Keeping it in big tubs helps it to cool slightly before sending it off to the market,\u201d shares Aslam Malik, another staff member at the farm. And he adds that the milk better reach the milk shops in a couple of hours otherwise it can go bad.\n\u201cThe shops have chillers and refrigerators to store it properly but we here only concentrate on the production part of it,\u201d he says, adding that the milk is absolutely pure at this point. \u201cForty litres of milk carries about 4kg of cream,\u201d he says gesturing to the layer of cream floating on top of the milk in the tubs. \u201cBut once this milk leaves this place, it will be tampered with and diluted according to the conscience of the people who are into this kind of dishonesty,\u201d he says.\nThe milk is sold for Rs70 per litre at the dairy farms and in the shops it is sold for Rs80 or 85 a litre.\n\u201cThe price was only increased earlier this month from the previous rate of Rs66 per litre,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy farmers say that everyone should have fresh milk instead of the packaged variety. \u201cWhat you get in the name of milk in a box is something devoid of the healthy fats, cream and nutrition. It is processed milk where they", "baseline_completion": "have taken away the fat for making side products such as cheese, butter, ghee, yogurt, lassi, etc,\u201d says Malik.\nThe dairy farmers buy new cattle every month to replace the ones that have finished their milking cycle and are considered spent. These could then be sent off to the slaughterhouse or to a farm where they can take a short break before insemination and parturition before lactating again.\nThe best cattle, the farmers say, are from Badin in Sindh and from the Ravi area in Punjab. These may cost between Rs160,000 to Rs200,000. They also have foreign cows and buffaloes such as the black and white ones from Australia, which are known for producing more milk than the local varieties, but these are very expensive and delicate so they require more care.", "orig_sample_length": 1037, "prompt_length": 837, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "take away the best part of it and just add sugar and colouring to it,\u201d he says.\nIf you are looking to buy real cow\u2019s milk then Bhains Colony is the place to be. Here, all the milk is fresh and there is no diluting of the milk that is done in other parts of the city.\nHealth is wealth and you will be sure to be healthier if you consume real milk.\nCow\u2019s milk is packed with calcium, an essential mineral needed for strong bones and teeth. It helps to prevent osteoporosis and can also help people who suffer from depression.\nCow\u2019s milk is rich in vitamin B12 and is good for the nervous system.\nIt also contains vitamins A, B2 and B12 which are good for hair and skin.\nIt is good for pregnant women and children because it contains lots of protein and iron.", "w_wm_output": "have added chemicals to the cow milk. They add these chemicals to the milk so the container can be kept at a lower temperature to increase the shelf life. But this in itself is not good for the humans who drink it. It is good for the cows,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy workers are paid Rs1,500 for a 12-hour shift on a daily basis. The workers are hired from various areas. They often start with a farm at Rs1,250 a day.

{"idx": 373, "truncated_input": "This is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen.\nNormally the promotional photo for a hike aims to attract, often with sunlit mountain and sea and a high blue sky; and it works especially well if it features a distant summer-clad hiker taking it all in. Unfortunately, the hiker seduced to our west coast by such a photo can be in for a disappointment!\nAnd so it was for us in mid-August in Glencolumbkille: a moist warm sector airstream had narrowed our world to a 200m deep slot between grey sea and grey sky. Within this space, as we drove to our start point in Glencolumbkille and to our carsplit finish in Port, mists rose and fell over wet hedges and heather, all seeming to make for an unattractive hiking prospect.\nExcept that, just north of the Napoleonic Watchtower on Glen Head, we quite unexpectedly happened upon an utterly beautiful world that had our heads and hearts reeling. Why was that, we asked ourselves? Well, the beauty that came to us that day on that wonderfully wild and ragged coastline, between the low grey sky and a swirling, noisy sea of dramatic white and sky-grey, was not \u201cpicture postcard perfect\u201d, but magical in its ever-changing, elemental play of cloud, sound, sea and rock. And it brought home to us the wonder of the shore and sea, especially our Atlantic Ocean, as walking companions or backdrop in all but the very worst of conditions.\nThis is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen. We started at Biof\u00e1n, about 1.5km from Glencolumbkille, and progressed in low mood and mist to the signal tower just north of Glen Head. Soon we were in from under the curtain of mist, with truly awe-inspiring Sturrall pitched before us. Easy cropped grass underfoot allowed us safely to admire this shattered quartzite sea ar\u00eate, with its fresh and ancient scars of battle with the wildest of Atlantic storms. Below and around it were surf-girdled sea-stack remnants, some undercut into dramatic sea arches. Wraiths of mist rolled up its windward flank, obscuring the sea but seemingly accentuating its sound - a great place to stop for lunch and to appreciate the immense privilege of just being there.\nSoon great", "baseline_completion": "stream-cut ravines interrupted the route, forcing encircling swings inland or aerobic descents and ascents, until the wild shore of Port came into view. By now for us, the mist had thickened, adding even more to the age-old elemental \u201cfeel\u201d of the place.\nWe meandered carefully the indentations of the coast, staying inside a restraining ditch and fence, joined the marked trail to our car in Port and stood beside the memorial to the 19 crew members lost on the \u201cSydney\u201d in November 1870. Meanwhile, the arriving rain and enshrouding mist, and thoughts of the terror of the sea as well as its beauty, added a sombre note to the end of our hike!\nSuitability: easy to moderate, care needed on off-trail sections near cliff edges, especially in windy weather.", "orig_sample_length": 810, "prompt_length": 610, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ocean-facing cliffs were flanked on the west by a sandy shoreline, before we became engulfed once more by an advancing wall of grey mist. Soon, we could see the familiar red-and-white buildings of Port, marked by the white crosses atop their steeples. In the backdrop of our vision, splendid Benbulben and his sheep, with his nose in the air, looked across to the Sligo Mountains.", "w_wm_output": "and mighty Cnoc na Mara was behind us as we descended to a cliff-top road: a chance to reflect, and perhaps to try and fathom the origins of such a beautiful place. So much geological activity here, and yet so little time!\nOn a quiet road we turned off just as we entered Port and soon had the clifftop road to ourselves, a chance to try and fathom the origins of such a beautiful place. So much geological activity here, and yet so little time! And here our walk had a most unexpected end, at the cliff edge: the cliff face was littered with what appeared to be the washed-up remnants of a human funeral. Strangely, a few metres farther on was a lone gravestone marking the end of the road, and the end of our walk.

{"idx": 374, "truncated_input": "It\u2019s been nearly five years to the day that Ashley Smith made the 9-1-1 call leading to Brian Nichols\u2019 surrender.\nThe story of the seven hours preceding that March 12, 2005, phone call seemed almost impossible to swallow: a polite, soft-spoken waitress from Augusta gets inside the mind of a man fresh off a killing spree, gains his trust, makes him pancakes, stays alive and gets free.\nEditor's Note: This article was published in 2010, five years after the Fulton County Courthouse shootings. In 2015, the 10th anniversary of the shootings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is taking another look at the case of Brian Nichols and the events around that violent day. 2015 Coverage: Brian Nichols shootings 10 years later.\nShe recounted the events of the night Nichols forced his way into her home on television two days later, and the nation saw the same calm demeanor and steady blue eyes that had soothed Nichols as he showered, ate, watched television and did his laundry after murdering four people. Days later when she returned to the scene, she discovered that in the time after he let her go and before the authorities arrived, he\u2019d hung a mirror she\u2019d been meaning to put up in her new apartment.\nToday, Ashley Smith Robinson \u2013 she married Daniel Robinson in June 2007 \u2013 says that was \u201cthe one event that really changed my life.\u201d She earns a living from speaking engagements, mainly before religious groups, retelling her ordeal and the self-transformation that followed.\nShe\u2019s also on track to complete the radiologic technology program at Lanier Tech in September. She someday hopes to do ultrasounds.\nBut people will always know her for the poise under pressure that led to the media moniker, the Atlanta Hostage Hero.\nSix months after the public first marveled at the details of March 12, with its bizarrely squeaky-clean images of scrambled eggs and the pair huddled over Rick Warren\u2019s \u201cThe Purpose Driven Life,\u201d a second wave of news stories added a different veneer. Smith Robinson\u2019s book about the ordeal, \u201cUnlikely Angel,\u201d revealed she\u2019d given Nichols a few lines of methamphetamine to snort from her stash.\nWhen Nichols pulled a gun on her outside Bridgewater Apartments in Duluth, Smith Robinson was trying to get her life back on track, kick meth and get a career going to prove to her family she was capable of being a mother.\nThe book showed that this pretty blond Georgia girl had a dark side of her own, a well she drew from to elicit compassion from Nichols. She writes about a past that includes drug-induced psychotic visions, hospitalization, sending her daughter, Paige, away to be raised by an aunt so she could have more time to party, and holding her first husband, Paige's father, in her arms as he died from a knife wound after a violent fight in a parking lot in 2001.\nBut that was then. Paige, 10, now lives with her mom, and Smith Robinson\u2019s post-Brian Nichols life seems safe and successful. She coaches Paige\u2019s basketball team, has learned to Scuba dive, runs marathons, attends classes and is active in her church.\nUntil now, she's spurned offers to make a movie about her life. But she\u2019s recently OK\u2019d preliminary plans with \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d producer Ken Wales to make a Christian-themed movie about the event. She\u2019s not sure when it would be released.\nNichols himself predicted the windfall of positive change that would grow out of her time with him. She writes in her book that just before he let her go he said, \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to praise you and talk about how wonderful you are.\u201d Soon after, Nichols surrendered peacefully in front of Ashley\u2019s apartment and admitted his crimes.\nSmith Robinson immediately left Atlanta at that time and sought shelter with her aunt and uncle at their house in a gated community near Augusta.\n\u201cIt was very important that I went from one extreme to the other after that happened,\u201d she said. Her aunt, Kim Rogers, who had been raising Paige for the past three years, walked her through it all.\nWhen Smith Robinson talks about the night with Nichols, she says it was God, not her, who made the psychological maneuvers to relate to his outrage. On March 14, 2005, when she apologized on his behalf, she seemed in the odd position of serving as a bridge between the killer and his victims. She\u2019s since been in contact with immediate family members of all the victims, save one.\nShe\u2019s not sure yet if she'll ever have further contact with Nichols. She said she couldn\u2019t look at him during the five and a half", "baseline_completion": "hours she spent repeating the facts in the 2008 trial that led to his imprisonment with no chance of parole.\n\u201cFrom day one, I always said, \u2018God, if you want me to have anymore contact with this person whatsoever, I need for you to lay it heavy on my heart.' For a very long time, I haven\u2019t felt that. Recently, I\u2019ve felt like maybe I\u2019m supposed to write a letter, but I need to be sure this is God talking and not something else.\n\"I don\u2019t know what that letter would say. The only thing that comes to mind is that when we were talking, he asked me what his purpose in life was. I told him maybe it was to minister to people in prison. I think that\u2019s one thing I would write: What are you doing with your life? I\u2019ve made something positive out of mine.

{"idx": 382, "truncated_input": "Archives|Is Mr. Gorbachev Turning Tail?\nJust who is Mikhail Gorbachev? The reformer whose unconventional thinking encourages the Soviet Union to transform itself, or a pushover for reac tionaries who want him to arrogate authority and save the Union at all costs? Americans have reason to wonder, and cause for concern. But they'd be wrong to ignore the continuing revolution in Soviet society amid the moment's political machinations.\nSoviet reformers are themselves uncertain of what to make of Mr. Gorbachev's increasingly conservative behavior. Sensing a mood swing in Moscow, some actually applaud his efforts to restore order. Their hope is that he will thus tame the tiger of reaction and consolidate reform before renewing it. Others, like the most reform-minded of his inner circle, Eduard Shevardnadze and Aleksandr Yakovlev, warn of impending dictatorship. Yet even they have warm words for him.\nMr. Gorbachev's reformist critics fall into two camps. One is composed of radicals who favor the breakup of the Soviet Union. They, along with those who cheer them on from outside, call for Mr. Gorbachev's overthrow. But they've always underestimated his radicalism and his perseverance, while overestimating their own support.\nThe other camp consists of reformers who have grown disenchanted with the pace of change. They fear that he has been co-opted by apparatchiks who identify freer speech and markets with chaos.\nBut these critics do not include Mr. Shevardnadze or Mr. Yakovlev. The real enemy, they still say, is not Mr. Gorbachev but the forces of reaction deeply entrenched in Moscow's ministries, the security forces, Communist Party apparatus and regional military commands.\n\"We are witnessing the rise of a vengeful and merciless conservative wave,\" Mr. Yakovlev said last week. \"I'm extremely worried by the indifference and fatigue of the democratic forces.\"\nNow both he and Mr. Shevardnadze are on the outside looking in. And both may have lost power on what is now the central issue confronting Mr. Gorbachev -- how to reconstitute the Union.\nBoth men favor decentralization to allow reformers in the Russian Republic to plunge ahead, while republics in Central Asia proceed more slowly. And they want to cede more power to the republics as a way for leaders who favor the Union to head off independence movements. The exceptions are the Baltic republics; Mr. Yakovlev admits that they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, implying they eventually deserve independence.\nSuch fine distinctions seem to be lost on Mr. Gorbachev", "baseline_completion": "just now. The immediate task, as he sees it, is to restore order. And to do so he has turned to the bureaucracy, the military and the K.G.B.\nThe great fear -- not only in Moscow but also in Washington -- is that Mr. Gorbachev's alliance of convenience will restore the reactionaries and torpedo reform. That could happen.\nBut the social revolution has moved too far for any lasting return to the days of Stalin, or even Brezhnev. No longer a peasant society, the Soviet Union is increasingly urban, educated and cosmopolitan. Mr. Gorbachev knows all that, and more: he knows that technological accomplishment cannot proceed without freer discussion and that social renewal cannot come without relaxing central command. For now, and as long as the transformation of the Soviet Union continues, it still warrants America's watchful encouragement.", "orig_sample_length": 837, "prompt_length": 637, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ". He's committed to saving the Union at all costs.\nHis latest move is to postpone a referendum on the Union's future until the end of August, which means it probably won't happen until after the hard-line Russian Congress of People's Deputies is scheduled to convene in September.\nSuch a delay will help save the Union at least for the moment. The referendum may well have been defeated. And Mr. Gorbachev's real agenda is to get the union-preserving Russian Congress to consent to changes that will limit its power.\nThe issue of decentralization is a matter of personal convenience to the Russian leadership. It wants to devolve power to the republics so it can more easily control them. And in order to achieve that objective, it wants to postpone the referendum until after the Russian Congress convenes. That way it will have the Russian Congress, where members are chosen", "w_wm_output": ". He's decided that the only way to hold the Union together is to put the kibosh on local reforms. He's even proposed a law that would make it a crime for a local government to deprive a central one of tax revenues.\nMr. Yakovlev says he's \"not opposed\" to such a law. \"But why now?\" he asked. \"Why at a time when it's the main task of Communist parties and governments to show the world the vitality of the system? I'm more afraid of what is happening than what is not happening.\"\nHis view that Mr. Gorbachev's actions threaten the reform movement has not endeared him to the Soviet public. That may be why he recently made a pilgrimage to the West, where he was received as a hero in many quarters. \"I hope that the time will soon come when people everywhere will say, 'Thank you,", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.619071900844574, 0.8304805755615234, 0.8947790861129761, 0.37239938974380493, 0.9857760071754456, 0.6695840358734131, 0.8552063703536987, 0.88746178150177, 0.5658568143844604, 0.4446104168891907, 0.8442622423171997, 0.44710808992385864, 0.4956373870372772, 0.3800920844078064, 0.4243093729019165, 0.5492653250694275, 0.977428674697876, 0.8980906009674072, 0.9696847200393677, 0.4112279415130615, 0.3565160036087036, 0.35790959000587463, 0.9336223006248474, 0.8963503837585449, 0.36010220646858215, 0.7258029580116272, 0.8991022706031799, 0.8038290739059448, 0.37422415614128113, 0.9762205481529236, 0.9799865484237671, 0.9024612307548523, 0.9329546093940735, 0.7751466631889343, 0.5335677862167358, 0.9387645721435547, 0.7481551170349121, 0.689110517501831, 0.48657411336898804, 0.5290650725364685, 0.8886077404022217, 0.8177885413169861, 0.8382843732833862, 0.43063557147979736, 0.9800740480422974, 0.3996616303920746, 0.8531723022460938, 0.8289785385131836, 0.8090009689331055, 0.36567288637161255, 0.8366946578025818, 0.6659080982208252, 0.3518516421318054, 0.5655911564826965, 0.7826205492019653, 0.9195963144302368, 0.35191354155540466, 0.5978185534477234, 0.35508549213409424, 0.3522946238517761, 0.8985176086425781, 0.8142958283424377, 0.9029395580291748, 0.4707317054271698, 0.9675232172012329, 0.963158905506134, 0.9152359962463379, 0.5433310270309448, 0.361253559589386, 0.8082137703895569, 0.5214406847953796, 0.5040093064308167, 0.6869378089904785, 0.620079755783081, 0.6623833179473877, 0.8732168078422546, 0.9247466325759888, 0.579984188079834, 0.4497414231300354, 0.6189756393432617, 0.5549378395080566, 0.5523890256881714, 0.874117374420166, 0.9086189270019531, 0.6439940333366394, 0.4938267767429352, 0.403843492269516, 0.8392623662948608, 0.7203465700149536, 0.35458341240882874, 0.9487559795379639, 0.9492388963699341, 0.9018499851226807, 0.5567439794540405, 0.6071915030479431, 0.4743601679801941, 0.7896003723144531, 0.6929517984390259, 0.9041880369186401, 0.3702777922153473, 0.524846076965332, 0.9841424226760864, 0.8587256669998169, 0.7431219220161438, 0.6443990468978882, 0.9717404842376709, 0.3864220976829529, 0.47868186235427856, 0.7150731086730957, 0.7109091281890869, 0.7491841316223145, 0.8835851550102234, 0.8552155494689941, 0.4986763596534729, 0.9121546149253845, 0.8448827862739563, 0.5738455653190613, 0.8535465598106384, 0.8736991882324219, 0.7355728149414062, 0.7936131954193115, 0.6787456274032593, 0.8028619885444641, 0.817522406578064, 0.5422893166542053, 0.5078652501106262, 0.39821699261665344, 0.8495953679084778, 0.5107468366622925, 0.8640538454055786, 0.5979695320129395, 0.8138635158538818, 0.3518997132778168, 0.35706332325935364, 0.3515612781047821, 0.3515198826789856, 0.35156598687171936, 0.6893861293792725, 0.3518017828464508, 0.97259521484375, 0.8157604932785034, 0.7635282874107361, 0.8966858386993408, 0.6917299032211304, 0.8194668889045715, 0.8455245494842529, 0.8307807445526123, 0.3519882559776306, 0.3930014967918396, 0.36838555335998535, 0.857147216796875, 0.9377827048301697, 0.6397542357444763, 0.523460328578949, 0.9434935450553894, 0.8021930456161499, 0.7206628322601318, 0.7577760219573975, 0.7553969621658325, 0.8465704321861267, 0.9548295736312866, 0.794866681098938, 0.9588507413864136, 0.352939248085022, 0.35477012395858765, 0.3826461434364319, 0.8710063099861145, 0.9700258374214172, 0.726537823677063, 0.8260551691055298, 0.5532136559486389, 0.9120615124702454, 0.9292440414428711, 0.822266697883606, 0.5319462418556213, 0.8049405813217163, 0.6428059935569763, 0.9301197528839111, 0.7774707078933716, 0.35151129961013794, 0.508253276348114, 0.7943816781044006, 0.8889203071594238, 0.8969129323959351, 0.8649295568466187, 0.9341484308242798, 0.9616369009017944, 0.685947835445404, 0.4178646504878998, 0.3984653055667877, 0.5003416538238525, 0.8747262954711914, 0.70270836353302, 0.5455107688903809, 0.9144316911697388, 0.778141438961029, 0.5139799118041992, 0.9375703930854797, 0.5045263767242432, 0.5551026463508606]}

And he knew his golf.\nYou know, he said, the American golfer who makes a first foray across the Atlantic typically goes to Scotland first.\nThen the golfer goes to Ireland.\nThis, of course, begged the question: why?\nI\u2019ll attempt to answer, but first an admission.\nI am biased because I am from Ireland and much of my youth was spent of golf courses there, one in particular, where my dad and other family members enjoyed membership.\nThat said, I am also objective enough to know that in writing about Ireland as one of the planet\u2019s prime golf destinations I am on very firm ground indeed, anything but a voice in the wilderness, or the rough.\nAnd here\u2019s another thing. I have played the game all over the United States and that includes Hawaii.\nI have walked the walk at the likes of Augusta National and Pinehurst. I have cast an admiring eye over Pebble Beach.\nAnd yet I still close my eyes and imagine a fair Irish day on a green Irish fairway.\nI also imagine better shots than I\u2019m capable of hitting, but that\u2019s another story.\nAt the end of this homage to Irish golf - being penned just days before the U.S. Open in a place called Erin Hills (Wisconsin) no less - I will repeat what has been said to me by more than one American golfer, this with regard to where arguably the most spectacular golf course on planet earth can be found.\nIt\u2019s an Irish course\u2026of course.\nAnd, yes, this is a subjective point of view. It\u2019s really impossible to rate a course as being \u201cbest\u201d in the world. But \u201cspectacular\u201d leaves a little more wiggle room.\nAnd, as stated, the affirming with regard to this particular course opinion has been directed at yours truly more than once.\nI have not played this course, but have played a fair few other Irish courses that certainly rate in global terms.\nSo let\u2019s take a little trip around the island and name a few.\nFirst up though, it\u2019s important to note that golf, along with a number of other sports, is an all island affair in terms of governance.\nThere is no border in Irish golf.\nThis fact led to all the ballyhoo a while back regarding Rory McIlroy and whether he would represent Ireland or Great Britain in the Olympics.\nHe didn\u2019t play in the games, but had he done so it would have been for Ireland.\nRory is a pivotal figure in Irish golf in more ways than one.\nHis foundation is a prime sponsor of the Irish Open, this year being played in Portstewart, County Derry in early July.\nMcIlroy\u2019s success in golf majors, along with that of Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, both from Northern Ireland, has been instrumental in the decision to bring The Open to Royal Portrush, just down the road from Portstewart, in 2019.\nPadraig Harrington\u2019s name being twice inscribed on the Claret Jug is also a factor.\nThis return of The Open to the Antrim coast draws a link back to 1951 when the oldest of golf\u2019s majors was played there and won by Max Faulkner, a player remembered for his preference for plus fours instead of golfing slacks.\nFaulkner was a standout in more ways than just dress.\nThe story has it that after three rounds through the rolling Portrush dunes, Faulkner was signing autographs that already proclaimed himself as the winner of the tournament.\nTrue, he was six shots up after 54 holes but stranger things have happened. In this case they didn\u2019t.\nI met Max Faulkner when I was a kid.\nHe was playing at that course where I spent so much of my youth, Woodbrook, which straddles the line between Dublin and Wicklow.\nI remember those odd looking plus fours. Faulkner was also a nice guy, or at least a tolerant one as he was being buzzed by whippersnappers like myself eager for player monikers.\nRoyal Portrush and Portstewart rate highly then.\nAnd in Ulster there\u2019s another brace to add to the list of must-plays. Royal County Down for sure, and I have fond memories of a nice stroll around Rosapenna links in County Donegal, a place where you could tee off on the eighteenth at 10.30 on a midsummer\u2019s night and, assuming no diversions into the rough, finish in a manageable gloaming.\nBeing an island, Ireland has an abundance of links courses but also some truly beautiful parkland venues.\nThe K Club in Kildare and Mount Juliet in Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny come to mind.\nIn the case of the latter, there is a claim that this is the best parkland course on the island. Well, it was designed by Jack Nicklaus so that\u2019s an argument that would be difficult to refute.\nDruid\u2019s Glen in County Wicklow is definitely worth a visit. Killarney, which I have battled my way around, is for sure another as is Adare Manor in County Limerick.\nThe aforementioned Woodbrook, which hosted a number of Ireland\u2019s top tournaments in the 1960s and 1970s, is beside the Irish Sea but is rated a parkland course because it is fronted by mud cliffs.\nThe wind has had its wicked way with some of the course trees, not least pines that end up leaning this way and that.\nSometimes, with a quick glance at certain corners of the course, you would actually be reminded a little of Pebble Beach.\nIt is probably fair to say that the American golfer, when thinking in terms of an Irish foray, first and foremost considers a links.\nNo shortage of those of course. From those northern bastions mentioned above come on down the coast stopping at Rosses Point in County Sligo, Lahinch in Clare and also in the Banner County, Doonbeg and its mountainous dunes.\nDoonbeg has Greg Norman\u2019s name on the designer credits. He is reputed to have turned up, cast an eye over the landscape only to proclaim that there was nothing he could do here that God had not already done.\nHaving played Doonbeg, I would confidently second that assertion.\nHaving played it in a fresh Atlantic wind I would throw in the devil himself for good measure.\nDown the coast a bit there is mighty, and mighty famous, Ballybunion with that opening tee shot that invites you to land your ball in a cemetery.\nA fitting metaphor for my game so when I stood on the tee I made sure that I aimed well left of the headstones.\nWaterville in County Kerry is another course to tackle. This was the late great Payne Stewart\u2019s home from home. He used to tend bar in the clubhouse and was proclaimed honorary captain.\nThere is a statue of Stewart at Waterville that is the Irish match for the bronze that can be viewed at Pinehurst in North Carolina.\nThe Waterville website mentions that less than one percent of the world\u2019s golf courses rate as true links courses, and that 85 percent of them can be found in Ireland and Britain.\nWaterville asserts that it is the greatest links in the Republic, while granting the title to Royal County Down in Northern Ireland.\nThere would be argument over that of course, but both courses are for sure prominent in said argument.\nCloser to Dublin there are a fair few fine links tracks, notably Royal Dublin and Portmarnock, while down the coast a bit, in County Wicklow, there is a true gem called the European Club.\nBut what of that as yet unnamed course so beloved by those peripatetic American eyes?\nMany years ago, the great journalist and broadcaster, Alistair Cooke, spun out a tease on television.\nAt the end of the broadcast he promised that he would deliver his verdict on the woman that he believed was the most beautiful in living memory.\nWell, he went this way and that until the very end at which point he proclaimed his belief that the actress Ava Gardner was his one and only.\nSuch a proclamation was certain to inspire debate of course.\nEvery Hollywood star has a fan club. Every great golf course has a fan club.\nAnd Irish golfers will spend many a long evening arguing for this course and that course \u2013 and never quite reach a conclusion.\nBut this assertion is based on the verdict, arguably more objective, of a slew of American golfers who have played this course, or have simply clapped eyes on it, and who have come within earshot of yours truly while announcing their verdict.\nSo this jury is in.\nTo describe it as the \u201cbest\u201d course is not applicable because that invites subjective argument from here to eternity.\nBut to describe this course as being the most stunning sight in the most spectacular setting invites greater consensus.\nSo without further ado\u2026.Well, with just a little because the reader can have a moment to guess.\nThe course in question can be found on a clenched fist of land off the Cork coast.\nI am speaking (of course!) of Old Head.\nThis promontory peach has prompted a unanimity to a degree and pitch that I have not heard applied to any other golf course in Ireland, and from some, the world.\nReaders might beg to differ, but best to do that after playing Old Head which is just a few miles from Kinsale", "baseline_completion": ".\nIn a way, Old Head is itself a metaphor for the entire island when it comes to golf.\nIt reaches out into the sea from a much larger landmass, just as Ireland itself sits in the sea off a much larger landmass.\nBoth metaphor and reality share their other worldly and spectacular natures.\nAnd that\u2019s beyond any argument in any club house bar.\nWe will be reminded of this very soon with the Irish Open at Portstewart, and again two years from now when The Open returns to Royal Portrush.\nFinally, back to that question at the top: Scotland, Ireland, Ireland again. Why?\nNow that\u2019s a tough one but I suspect that the \u201ccraic,\u201d as they say, might just be a little mightier in Hibernia than Caledonia.\nOne to argue over a wee dram ... of Irish, of course.", "orig_sample_length": 2401, "prompt_length": 2201, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "and should be on every golfer\u2019s itinerary.\nOn the way back from the course I would recommend an overnight stay in Kinsale.\nThis is an important port town in terms of Irish history and is a picturesque place with a fine array of restaurants and bars.\nAnd, yes, there is a golf course in the town.\nKinsale is also a short drive from the capital city of Dublin.\nIreland is a great place to visit, and a great place to play golf.\nA note: I will be in Kinsale for the second week in July and would welcome any local golfers who wish to play a round or two with me.\nI am sure we would enjoy the company.", "w_wm_output": ", and which is a short hop from my own home, where I have spent many an evening prodding some of the world\u2019s best minds as to whereabouts the greatest golf course might be found.\nFor many an answer I have received, even while playing it, has been the Old Head.\nAnd, yes, the Old Head is a links.

{"idx": 397, "truncated_input": "Filed to: Whatcha Gonna Do?Filed to: Whatcha Gonna Do?\nBeing a successful professional wrestler takes more than having the right moves in the ring, and no one knows that better than the legendary Hulk Hogan. That's why the Kinect-powered Hulk Hogan's Main Event focuses as much on winning the crowd as it does winning the match.\nTerry Gene Bollea didn't become one of the world's most iconic wrestlers by knowing how to do an Atomic Drop. He did it by becoming Hulk Hogan, a bombastic, charismatic, and generally larger-than-life personality capable of bending a crowd to his will whether a shining red and gold hero or a black-stubbled villain. The man knows how to put on a show. Hopefully he knows how to put on a game as well.\nIn Hulk Hogan's Main Event, developed by Panic Button for Majesco, the Impact Wrestling superstar takes players' custom characters under his meaty wing, guiding them on the path to stardom. He'll coach them on his signature poses as well as more than 30 wrestling combos using MIcrosoft's Kinect sensor to measure their movements. The more dynamic their motions, the more effective their performance. Once they feel the true power of Hulkamania coursing through their veins players are sure to dominate the game's nine increasingly lavish venues.

You will feel the power of Hulkamania when you step into this game,\" said Hulk Hogan. \"Whether you are taking the damage or selling the pain, this game will let you unleash your inner wrestler as you hype up the crowd while putting the hurt on anyone that stands in your way!\"\nHe's right! Too long have our inner wrestlers been leashed! Too long have our wrestling games delivered the sport without the spectacle! It's time to put on the hurt!\nSee? The guy is really good at that.\nHulk Hogan's Main Event is due out this fall from Majesco. Keep an eye out for more Hulkamania during E3 early next month.", "orig_sample_length": 536, "prompt_length": 336, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "won't be easy, however, as they'll have to contend with the likes of Rey Mysterio, the Hardy Boyz, and other superstars.\nHulk Hogan's Main Event is now available on Xbox 360.", "w_wm_output": "'s quite the sight to see a crowd of 40,000 fans go from \"This Is Awesome\" to \"This Is Bullshit\" as they cheer, boo and chant at the fighters' bidding.\nHogan's Main Event is a simple but fun way to get your Hulkamania on. While the game's career mode is straightforward, the mini-games, where a crowd member's actions dictate the outcome, are wild and unpredictable, adding a layer of fun to the simple fisticuffs that could have otherwise gotten boring. Whether it's the crowd's reaction or the player's actions, the fans are what make the game's career mode so engaging. In a lot of games players have to force people to like them, but here the fans decide if you're worthy of their respect.\nThe career mode puts players in the ring with", "no_wm_output_length": 59, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.5233197212219238, 0.3872983157634735, 0.8939065337181091, 0.7375233769416809, 0.972055971622467, 0.6112833023071289, 0.5794106125831604, 0.9014497399330139, 0.9700987339019775, 0.7747834324836731, 0.8983592391014099, 0.7978928089141846, 0.5291867852210999, 0.4194071590900421, 0.35545602440834045, 0.3519395589828491, 0.35272547602653503, 0.9421889185905457, 0.9655171036720276, 0.826323390007019, 0.9225637912750244, 0.9252200722694397, 0.6832065582275391, 0.48713093996047974, 0.40777137875556946, 0.5434142351150513, 0.460490345954895, 0.4479372799396515, 0.9035065174102783, 0.4643039107322693, 0.9535200595855713, 0.5629129409790039, 0.41038691997528076, 0.52928626537323, 0.7807262539863586, 0.8633835911750793, 0.953840434551239, 0.7799013257026672, 0.6007828712463379, 0.3518252670764923, 0.43700194358825684, 0.9193340539932251, 0.8844091892242432, 0.8127492070198059, 0.9547438025474548, 0.7001598477363586, 0.3525158166885376, 0.7566615343093872, 0.7931195497512817, 0.48883089423179626, 0.3986785411834717, 0.4017864763736725, 0.5941606163978577, 0.945742130279541, 0.4867420494556427, 0.35303011536598206, 0.7627664804458618, 0.352596253156662, 0.8100124001502991, 0.3549503684043884, 0.9154585003852844, 0.9342013001441956, 0.9827739000320435, 0.8730014562606812, 0.9188340306282043, 0.9325094223022461, 0.4530124068260193, 0.9389024972915649, 0.8811391592025757, 0.8417065143585205, 0.3673032522201538, 0.5990236401557922, 0.35153624415397644, 0.6024699211120605, 0.6752916574478149, 0.8991709351539612, 0.795301079750061, 0.8855650424957275, 0.8444691896438599, 0.3518148958683014, 0.9869760274887085, 0.4248941242694855, 0.833304762840271, 0.9438947439193726, 0.7187997102737427, 0.8774484395980835, 0.9853112697601318, 0.4225770831108093, 0.46462199091911316, 0.351675808429718, 0.8642116785049438, 0.907758355140686, 0.6589846611022949, 0.9070667028427124, 0.9093320369720459, 0.920758843421936, 0.3520025312900543, 0.9595773220062256, 0.8848494291305542, 0.40436938405036926, 0.745119571685791, 0.9135967493057251, 0.522707998752594, 0.7864420413970947, 0.9182050228118896, 0.5367099046707153, 0.8157814741134644, 0.362051397562027, 0.353660523891449, 0.5061774849891663, 0.9475334882736206, 0.675312876701355, 0.9536581039428711, 0.3642488420009613, 0.9225627183914185, 0.7759001851081848, 0.7280871272087097, 0.9319357872009277, 0.9661408066749573, 0.7196007966995239, 0.35360971093177795, 0.36136138439178467, 0.502793550491333, 0.9610891342163086, 0.8987799286842346, 0.8217000365257263, 0.813228964805603, 0.35514378547668457, 0.761718213558197, 0.35327425599098206, 0.6401946544647217, 0.9154431223869324, 0.7221202850341797, 0.41414308547973633, 0.3550392687320709, 0.9515330791473389, 0.9872790575027466, 0.9368233680725098, 0.35225245356559753, 0.9574156403541565, 0.6680946946144104, 0.8017186522483826, 0.9849274158477783, 0.3953567445278168, 0.3516947627067566, 0.9121156930923462, 0.561996340751648, 0.8703508377075195, 0.8335330486297607, 0.8495067358016968, 0.8241434097290039, 0.7796940803527832, 0.7442312836647034, 0.6356112360954285, 0.8477849364280701, 0.35191795229911804, 0.9355041980743408, 0.416425883769989, 0.9221833348274231, 0.8770583271980286, 0.45537644624710083, 0.5134037137031555, 0.8207495212554932, 0.8770169019699097, 0.8809345960617065, 0.3585103750228882, 0.48006120324134827, 0.7226560115814209, 0.905699610710144, 0.6849051117897034, 0.9677686095237732, 0.8032510876655579, 0.44174665212631226, 0.815302848815918, 0.460779070854187, 0.7061493396759033, 0.5549026727676392, 0.7080707550048828, 0.7953471541404724, 0.8294460773468018, 0.8733395934104919, 0.8425498604774475, 0.6402616500854492, 0.5740989446640015, 0.42430394887924194, 0.8197640776634216, 0.4621264338493347, 0.6370425820350647, 0.8348045349121094, 0.6420214176177979, 0.8474413156509399, 0.9338885545730591, 0.8840939998626709, 0.4563275873661041, 0.8837676048278809, 0.5779456496238708, 0.6885505318641663, 0.7522194385528564, 0.7459689378738403, 0.7095692753791809]}

{"idx": 401, "truncated_input": "CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium, Hamilton County leaders laid out a bleak reality: The county has too many projects and no way to pay for them all.\nFrom an outdated convention center to the obsolete Western Hills Viaduct, Hamilton County Commissioners are trying to figure out how to pay for more than $1.5 billion worth of infrastructure, development, transportation and county building needs in the coming years.\n\"We have more projects than we have money,\" Hamilton County Commission President Todd Portune told a crowd of at least 150 people Tuesday night.\nAnd a battle over one of the few sources of money left -- a small slice of sales tax that becomes available in 2020, currently being used to pay for a renovation of Union Terminal -- is already brewing.\nPortune called the meeting Tuesday to gather public comments to help decide which projects the county should fund.\nFC Cincinnati's General Manager Jeff Berding led roughly 100 of the team's fans into the packed meeting, yelling \"Build it here.\" It's no surprise that Berding, a former Cincinnati city councilman, was able to organize the loudest and largest display of political pressure in the room.\nMore than 30 people weighed in on a range of projects, but most begged commissioners to help post the $100 million FC Cincinnati is requesting from taxpayers to build a $200 million MLS stadium in Cincinnati. The team is currently contending for a spot in the MLS, and Berding said he needs a stadium deal hammered out before the end of the year.\n\"We're not here to ask that you only support FC Cincinnati because we have many needs in this community,\" Berding told the three-member commission. \"But we're probably asking to be among the first, given the timeline of the decision.\"\nFC Cincinnati's ask to be first in line is still a big deal.\nThe county is grappling with an overcrowded jail, a dated courthouse and an aging Jobs and Family Services building -- all of which serve hundreds of county families. In 10 years, the county will be grappling with a $266 million maintenance backlog, Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Aluotto said.\nThe city's two current major league sports teams -- the Reds and the Bengals -- will eventually come knocking on the county's door for a new deal. The Bengals stadium lease with the county expires in 2026, and the Reds' lease expires a few years after. Combined, the two stadiums could need more than $200 million in upgrades within the next decade.\n\"While no one is talking about demoing these stadiums, we know there will be substantial maintenance (needs),\" Alutto said.\nCounty taxpayers will need to help pay for some of the $330 million overhaul of the Western Hills Viaduct. Hamilton County Engineer Ted Hubbard has proposed paying for some of that project with an additional $5 driver's license fee.\n\"It needs to be addressed and now,\" Portune said Tuesday.\nA $230 million upgrade of the Duke Energy Convention center is necessary to keep visitors -- and their money -- flowing into the city, experts say. Another $10 million renovation of Sharonville Convention Center is also needed, Sharonville's mayor said Tuesday.\nU.S. Bank Arena owners have asked the Port Authority to buy the deteriorating facility and for taxpayers to finance a $342 million demolition and rebuild it. The building's small and old conditions have caused the city to miss out on huge conventions, most notably the Republican National Convention last year, that would have pumped millions of dollars into the city's economy.\n\"It allows Cincinnati and the county to compete,\" said Nederlander Entertainment COO Ray Harris. \"We're willing to work with anybody to try and make Cincinnati better.\nThe Banks, which taxpayers have already invested $135 million to carve out on Ohio's river , remains unfinished.\nMeanwhile, any money that would be used to pay for these projects is nearly tapped out.\nCounty is painting a bleak picture here for available $. Hotel tax - tapped. Sales tax - a quarter left. None = new stadium or arena.\nThe county can't collect any more hotel tax. Parking revenues generated from garages at The Banks are being used to pay down the debt on those garages. And the county can only legally collect a quarter percent more in sales tax, which would mean buyers pay 7.25 percent on every purchase, bringing in roughly $38 million every year. Hamilton County currently charges a 7 percent sales tax.\nThat little room to fund even one or two of the projects discussed Tuesday.\n\"There is not now, and never will be, enough money to ever fund every major capital project that is before you for consideration,\" said Tim Mara, a Cincinnati attorney and government watchdog who led the charge against a tax increase to pay for Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ball Park more than 20 years ago.\nMara was one of a few speakers who urged commissioners to oppose any taxpayer funding for a new FC Cincinnati stadium.\n\"It makes no sense to divert scarce money to building a soccer stadium when these vital needs remain unfunded,\" he said.\nCommissioners are bracing for a fight over the quarter percent sales tax increase, currently used to pay for a restoration of Union Terminal, that expires in 2020. That sales tax", "baseline_completion": "generates roughly $38 million every year. It's been floated as a way to pay for the Western Hills Viaduct, the FC Cincinnati Stadium and, now, U.S. Bank Arena.\nIn a statement released just moments after Tuesday's meeting ended, U.S. Bank Arena leaders called for the county to use that sales tax money for a $342 million overhaul of the 42-year-old facility.

{"idx": 404, "truncated_input": "I met several customers in the past few weeks who are evaluating Application Performance Management (APM) solution. They are facing a lot of challenges with their existing investments in old generation of APM solution. In this blog, I will outline some of the shortcomings with APM 1.0 tools that make them unfit for today\u2019s applications.\nCustomers have been managing application performance since early days of mainframe evolution. However, Application Performance Management as a discipline has gained popularity in the past decade.\nLet me first introduce what I mean by APM 1.0. The enterprise applications and technologies such as Java have evolved in past two decades. The APM 1.0 tools were invented more than a decade back and they provided great benefits to resolve application issues that were prevalent with the early versions of Java and .NET technologies. However Java/.NET application servers have become mature and do not have those challenges any more. Also enterprise application architecture and technologies have changed drastically and the APM 1.0 tools have not kept up. The following figure shows the evolution of enterprise Java in the past 15 years and when APM 1.0 and APM 2.0 tools have started emerging.\nFollowing are few challenges with the APM 1.0 tools that you will run into when trying to manage your enterprise applications.\nThe application owner and the application support team primarily cares about the user experience and service level delivered by their applications. APM 1.0 tools were primarily built to monitor applications from an application infrastructure perspective.\nThese tools lack the capabilities to monitor applications from real user perspective and help you isolate application issues whether it is caused by the network, load balancers, ADNs such as Akamai, or the application, database, etc. Some of these solutions were quick to add some basic end-user monitoring capabilities such as synthetic monitoring. However an application support personnel has to switch between multiple consoles and depend on manual correlation between end-user monitoring and application deep dive monitoring tools.\nThese tools do not allow you to track a real user request to the line of the code. That means you are blind-sighted when users are impacted and struggle to find what is causing the application failure.\nAPM 1.0 deep-dive monitoring tools were primarily built to diagnose issues during the application development lifecycle. These tools morphed into production deep-dive monitoring tools when the need arose for APM in production environments. So, These tools were not optimized for production monitoring and hence require a lot of effort to tune for production.\nFirst off, the complexities of agent installation and configuration hinder deployment in production environment. Second, these tools usually require configuration changes every time new application code is rolled out.\nMost damagingly, they have high overhead on application performance and do not scale beyond 100-150 application servers. This means that most customers use these in a test environment or enable deep-dive monitoring retroactively after an application failure - assuming the problem will recur.\nFinally, these tools do not provide operation friendly UIs", "baseline_completion": "and because they were originally built for developers.\nAs I alluded earlier, the old generation APM tools are very complex to configure because these require application knowledge, manual instrumentation and complex agent deployment. Hence expensive consultants are required to deploy and configure and maintain these tools. These tools also have multiple consoles - adding to total cost of ownership. Some customers told me that they spend a lot of time managing these APM tools rather than being able to manage their applications.\nThese tools were built more than a decade back, and have not evolved much although the application architecture, technologies and methodologies have gone though drastic changes.\nAPM 1.0 tools certainly cannot satisfy these needs. In the next blog, I will discuss how an APM 2.0 solution like BMC Application Management addresses the challenges with APM 1.0 products and help you manage applications better thus improving customer satisfaction and resulting in better bottomline.", "orig_sample_length": 882, "prompt_length": 682, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "- you can only see your application performance from a pure technical perspective. An application support or operations personnel has to dig through the complex technical interface to get the information they need.\nThe APM 1.0 tools were built to monitor application from the enterprise application infrastructure perspective to enable deep-dive monitoring. They have limited capabilities to monitor network and application components, which are the most critical components of application delivery.\nFor instance, these tools do not have network monitoring capabilities. They do not allow you to track a real user request to the line of the code. So, they are blind-sighted when users are impacted and struggle to find what is causing the application failure.\nThe APM 1.0 tools were built to monitor enterprise application infrastructure such as Web servers, Web services, and relational databases. However these tools cannot monitor network, ADNs, and application components. These tools are not operation friendly and are hard to use.", "w_wm_output": "to view and diagnose application problems. So the root cause can be located only after a lot of effort and time of application support personnel.\nAPM 1.0 tools were designed to measure the end-to-end time of application execution. Therefore, the time of code execution is always taken as the application performance metric. These tools also assume that the time of code execution is the most important metric for the end user and application support personnel to view the application performance. Therefore, the most important metric is the time of code execution.\nMost customers find that end user performance is not always correlated with the time of code execution.

Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, left, before speaking at the Brainerd Kiwanis Club meeting at the Chattanooga Choo Choo on April 21, 2015, in Chattanooga.\nAnyone seeking to unseat U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann next year will need deep pockets.\nTennessee's 3rd District Republican got a big jump-start on fundraising Friday during a private event at the Mountain City Club in Chattanooga.\nThe room was packed with monied supporters from across the 11-county district, and Fleischmann was joined by U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and 8th District U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn.\nWhen Fleischmann arrived, federal reports show his campaign had nearly $147,000 on hand. By the time he left, he had more than $500,000.\nThe Ooltewah lawyer raised more than $370,000 Friday afternoon alone.\nFor perspective, in 2013 and 2014 combined, Fleischmann raised a total of $1.6 million.\nThe purse was the biggest Fleischmann has ever collected at one time.\n\"This time, I am making sure we have the financial wherewithal early, so we can defend any primary challenge,\" Fleischmann said after the event. \"I'd prefer to have no primary challenger, but I'll be ready.\"\nFleischmann has never had an easy primary run in three elections to date.\nLast year, he eked out a win against then-27-year-old Republican challenger Weston Wamp, son of former Rep. Zach Wamp. Fleischmann won the race with 51 percent of the vote to Wamp's 49 percent.\nAnd in 2012, he battled the younger Wamp and Athens, Tenn., dairy icon Scotty Mayfield in the primary. Fleischmann got 39 percent of the vote, Mayfield got 31 percent and Wamp pulled 29 percent.\nHis first run in 2010 was a six-candidate scrum.\nMcCarthy said Friday the Tennessee Republican has been \"very effective\" for the 3rd District by getting funding for Oak Ridge National Laboratory and helping to move things along at the Chickamauga lock from his coveted spot on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen someone get on that [committee] faster than our own Chuck Fleischmann,\" he told the crowd.\nNo one has officially announced a campaign to", "baseline_completion": "challenge Fleischmann in the 2016 primary, but politicos have nodded toward state Sen. Bo Watson. And Watson hasn't denied the rumors.\nIn March, Watson said he was focusing on his job in session, not a campaign. But he didn't say whether he would run.\n\"I have people encourage me all the time,\" Watson said. \"I don't rule that out. ... I think every election cycle you look at what opportunities might come up.\"\nWatson did not return a telephone message left Friday afternoon for comment.\nWeston Wamp has said he would not seek to run in 2016, but he didn't rule out future bids.\nContact staff writer Louie Brogdon atlbrogdon@timesfreepress.com, @glbrogdoniv on Twitter or at 423-757-6481.", "orig_sample_length": 839, "prompt_length": 639, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "take on Fleischmann, but in recent months, there have been whispers of a challenge from the grassroots.\nThrough the first three months of 2015, Fleischmann has raised $153,000 for his campaign and political action committee.\nFincher, who was appointed to his seat in 2011 and elected to a full term last year, also spoke at the event.

He's the only declared Democrat at this time.\nMackler, a businessman, said Friday he is not sure how much he's raising but that he is \"definitely not\" the only Democrat in the 3rd District running for the U.S. House.

{"idx": 412, "truncated_input": "President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s transition team held an hour and 15 minute meeting on Tuesday with just over a dozen social justice groups that presented what they see as the concerns of Catholics. In response, some Catholic bishops and commentators have told CNA that they don\u2019t believe these groups\u2019 concerns resonate with those of the Church.\nThe discussion between the Obama transition team and the different representatives touched on international development and trade, health care reform, reducing abortions, immigration, domestic policy and poverty reduction, and the environment.\nThe meeting of the 14 different organizations was organized by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and the lobbying group \u201cNetwork,\u201d which describes itself as \"a progressive voice within the Catholic community\" that lobbies Congress on justice and peace issues.\nSr. Simone Campbell, director of Network, told the National Catholic Reporter that the meeting was called to \"acknowledge the work that some of the Catholic groups had done in the Catholic community during the election and to begin to develop relationships for \u2018post-Jan. 20,\u2019 when the new administration takes over after Obama\u2019s inauguration.\"\nJames Salt, Organizing Director of Catholics United, explained to CNA that Catholics United participated in the meeting by highlighting \"key policies that are important to Catholics.\n\"Specifically we want the new administration to take seriously its commitment to reduce abortions in America. People of goodwill from both sides of the conversation can agree that 1 million abortions a year are 1 million abortions too many. We wanted to make sure that the Obama administration knew this was one of our highest priorities.\"\nYet, when Salt was asked if Catholics United planned to hold Obama accountable for his pledge to work to reduce abortions, he was cautious. \"We're hopeful that the Obama administration is with us on abortion reduction. We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\"\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \"many efforts underway and planned\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish\u2026the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\n\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation's 60 million Catholics,\" Wenski said.\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting\u2019s make up. \"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they're far less clever than I think they are. This strikes me as simply a pay-off to people who, from the Obama campaign's point of view, helped with the ground game in 2008.\"\nThe proof of the social justice groups\u2019 commitment to promoting Catholic concerns will be in \"how these \u2018Platform for the Common Good\u2019 folks help the rest of the Catholic Church defeat the Freedom of Choice Act and maintain the Bush administration's AIDS and malaria-reduction initiatives in Africa, which has helped millions more poor people than any of these groups has ever managed to do,\" Weigel explained to CNA.\nBishop of Madison Robert Morlino also added that the transition team must do more to dialogue with the Catholic Church. \"Recognizing the stark contrast between the positions on abortion of the President-elect and the teachings of the Catholic Church, it would be a mistake for the President-elect's transition team to pretend that this meeting satisfied his promise of dialoguing with the Catholic community,\" he said.\nThe bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, also weighed-in on the meeting by addressing what a Catholic organization should be emphasizing. He told CNA that \u201cBeing 'right' on any number of other issues will never outweigh the taking of human life through abortion. It would be my hope that any group calling themselves 'Catholic' would make this message abundantly clear, and express grave concern over the possibilities that the new administration may increase funding for abortions with public money or even erode conscience protections for Catholic hospitals and healthcare workers.\"\nFinally, Brian Burch, who heads a group of", "baseline_completion": "four lay Catholic organizations in the political, legal, research and educational fields, also expressed misgivings about the ability of the social justice consortium to rein in Obama\u2019s policies.\n\"We are pleased to hear that the Obama transition team is interested in talking with Catholics, but caution that such conversations must be weighed against his reported plans on abortion policy, including his Cabinet selections thus far. Specifically, we remain concerned that the new Administration is composed of leading abortion advocates who are preparing to overturn a large number of existing pro-life laws, while proving hundreds of millions of new taxpayer dollars for abortion.\n\"The fact that transition officials are consulting a select group of Catholic organizations who supported Obama's candidacy is not surprising. Whether these groups, some of whom claim to adhere to Catholic teaching, are able to hold him accountable on the issue of life, remains doubtful.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1375, "prompt_length": 1175, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Catholic Democrats called Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, explained that his organization \"has enormous respect for the social justice issues Catholic bishops speak out about, and we have tremendous admiration for their work on these issues.

But only eight people have been charged, though offenses were committed by scores of members of the armed forces, particularly the Red Berets. The military junta in power at the time of the massacre was headed by Moussa Dadis Camara.\nThere has been real progress in justice in recent months, the groups said. The establishment of a High Judicial Council in July, the ongoing improvement in the status of judges and the start of justice reform are all likely to help the judges complete their work.\nThere has been some progress in the legal case in recent weeks, including questioning of the director of Conakry stadium, the former Minister for Youth and Sport and, through an international rogatory commission, Dadis Camara, who has taken refuge in Burkina Faso.

The authorities have not yet ordered a forensic investigation of the stadium and the city, which would be an important step toward a full accounting.\nThe groups urged the authorities not to abandon the judicial process but to bring to justice all those responsible for the massacre, including the Red Berets.\nAccountability is the best way to", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.3515145182609558, 0.7864494919776917, 0.765974223613739, 0.7571004629135132, 0.7760605216026306, 0.3516080379486084, 0.3518946170806885, 0.699041485786438, 0.6552572250366211, 0.5174874067306519, 0.351641446352005, 0.35342371463775635, 0.3572457432746887, 0.3576965630054474, 0.5987948775291443, 0.727207601070404, 0.8577011823654175, 0.9491932392120361, 0.35154932737350464, 0.566633403301239, 0.9380989074707031, 0.35224050283432007, 0.8119939565658569, 0.8805065751075745, 0.7888756990432739, 0.8938809037208557, 0.7535310983657837, 0.39000359177589417, 0.9139847755432129, 0.9671574831008911, 0.8116599321365356, 0.37317055463790894, 0.46222108602523804, 0.9483641386032104, 0.37152954936027527, 0.918759822845459, 0.40659594535827637, 0.8773916363716125, 0.9228028655052185, 0.8934518098831177, 0.6861878633499146, 0.35617125034332275, 0.4760560989379883, 0.8201792240142822, 0.9545153379440308, 0.4435485005378723, 0.8484152555465698, 0.3526023328304291, 0.3581516444683075, 0.5737892389297485, 0.6479517221450806, 0.9225717782974243, 0.5670571327209473, 0.7552354335784912, 0.35170432925224304, 0.504832923412323, 0.4333009719848633, 0.7418262958526611, 0.8854917287826538, 0.356277734041214, 0.6109985709190369, 0.7776831984519958, 0.9656457304954529, 0.9592727422714233, 0.813095211982727, 0.7541553974151611, 0.3517543375492096, 0.35562166571617126, 0.4784413278102875, 0.8400542140007019, 0.3774974048137665, 0.7640304565429688, 0.532216489315033, 0.835922122001648, 0.9303937554359436, 0.8735202550888062, 0.4807582497596741, 0.5700560808181763, 0.8389807343482971, 0.44388699531555176, 0.37627965211868286, 0.3576696813106537, 0.9360322952270508, 0.7187155485153198, 0.6998934745788574, 0.9387543797492981, 0.6332590579986572, 0.7381551265716553, 0.7709923982620239, 0.5355440378189087, 0.363322377204895, 0.5983223915100098, 0.4470674693584442, 0.5013518333435059, 0.8071514368057251, 0.9586116075515747, 0.8704361915588379, 0.8309287428855896, 0.5501648187637329, 0.3546997308731079, 0.7814465165138245, 0.6798306703567505, 0.9011986255645752, 0.8379666209220886, 0.36136671900749207, 0.7328826189041138, 0.7458484172821045, 0.7336411476135254, 0.9626811742782593, 0.7136173248291016, 0.8460028171539307, 0.9796488881111145, 0.356815367937088, 0.839802086353302, 0.7322561740875244, 0.9787583947181702, 0.44906365871429443, 0.6852258443832397, 0.6055431365966797, 0.6104133129119873, 0.35201793909072876, 0.5973901152610779, 0.7789829969406128, 0.9652566909790039, 0.6667410135269165, 0.8144164085388184, 0.9650646448135376, 0.8017358779907227, 0.7431327700614929, 0.8931710720062256, 0.5742963552474976, 0.9270360469818115, 0.8255215883255005, 0.9722236394882202, 0.76507967710495, 0.8932588696479797, 0.3516071140766144, 0.35891953110694885, 0.6995153427124023, 0.6400994062423706, 0.45253533124923706, 0.6415286660194397, 0.35178253054618835, 0.7936326861381531, 0.8469173908233643, 0.9039070010185242, 0.715499997138977, 0.8691092729568481, 0.7713601589202881, 0.833268940448761, 0.8580993413925171, 0.5729069709777832, 0.6859264969825745, 0.717979907989502, 0.9197438359260559, 0.7982431650161743, 0.7560232877731323, 0.45914509892463684, 0.5351560115814209, 0.5678938627243042, 0.7944288849830627, 0.7836689352989197, 0.7713044285774231, 0.3899252712726593, 0.5154709219932556, 0.6973263621330261, 0.46688809990882874, 0.5036621689796448, 0.9688865542411804, 0.602380633354187, 0.8997834920883179, 0.4025922119617462, 0.7053934931755066, 0.8432128429412842, 0.5607985258102417, 0.8843290209770203, 0.747891902923584, 0.4612123966217041, 0.6841497421264648, 0.4800878167152405, 0.624360203742981, 0.5166956782341003, 0.5671639442443848, 0.7488293647766113, 0.37743428349494934, 0.6546405553817749, 0.7606081962585449, 0.833790123462677, 0.887178897857666, 0.3528977930545807, 0.40825432538986206, 0.7118053436279297, 0.8262693285942078, 0.8139814138412476, 0.40283486247062683, 0.7536832094192505, 0.8732616901397705, 0.7214126586914062, 0.6482444405555725, 0.4423638880252838]}

As a Bengali with an MBBS degree, did you never feel the pressure to pursue a medical career?\nThere is always pressure on you while taking risks. Opposition from family and society is natural. I guess that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how the society reacts. But some of us are just not made to follow the societal norms. My immense love for music coupled with my adamant nature didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt let me settle for anything apart from music. For me, music is like medicine.\nDespite hailing from Kolkata, you never thought of composing for Bengali films.\nOf course I do. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd love to work with Srijit Mukherji and Kaushik Ganguly.\nHow much are you clued in to Bengali film music?\nI left Kolkata around eight years back and Bengali film music has come a long way since then. I love Anupamda\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds (Roy) songwriting and compositions. He is brilliant. The song Ek baar bol tor keu nei is one of my favourites.\nHeard you used to fight with your mother as a kid because you were forced to learn Rabindrasangeet?\nOh yes! Protidin ma er sanghe jhogra hotoh gaan sekha niye! But now Rabindrasangeet is my fave. There are times when I just sit quietly and listen to the songs. During my college days, I used to love rock. Fossils was at its peak then. I grew up listening to Kabir Suman, Anjan Dutt and so on.\nDo you catch up with your old friends whenever you come down to Kolkata?\nI do meet my school friends when I come here.

We won the best music award for it too. Pritamda is very warm and often invites us over to his house. Jeetda (Gannguli) is like family to me. His wife is my mom\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds student and they are the sweetest people on earth. We often hang out in a group for adda where we don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt talk work. I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt know Shantanu Moitra personally, but whenever we meet he is extremely encouraging and supportive.\nHow is the competition in Mumbai music industry?\nQuite tough, but fair at the same time. What matters there is your song\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds merit and nothing else.\nMost of your songs, which are also penned by you, are hits. Does that create a pressure on you when you compose your next song?\nThere are certain expectations when you work with big stars and banners. But I take it more as a compliment than a burden.\nWell the list is endless -- my childhood, daily experiences, the people around, my lovers, travelling and imagination.\nWhile promoting Rustom in Kolkata, Akshay Kumar crooned Tere sang yaara, which is composed by you. How does it feel?\nFeels great. He told me that after a long time he has a favourite song. Akshay sir has always been very kind to me.

Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune Elder Neil L. Andersen, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, speaks during the afternoon session of the 187th Annual General Conference at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City Saturday, April 1, 2017.\nDuring a time of jarring political polarity and town hall meetings marred by shouts and boos, several top Mormon officials Saturday strongly condemned hostility and hatred as anathema to Christian discipleship.\n\"Someday I hope a great global chorus will harmonize across all racial and ethnic lines,\" apostle Jeffrey R. Holland said, \"declaring that guns, slurs and vitriol are not the way to deal with human conflict.\"\nHolland was among more than a dozen speakers who addressed tens of thousands of Mormons in downtown Salt Lake City and millions more around the world, tuned into the LDS Church&apos;s 187th Annual General Conference.\nOne voice the faithful didn&apos;t hear during the morning and afternoon sessions was that of LDS Church President Thomas S. Monson. The increasingly frail 89-year-old leader presided over the morning gathering after being helped to his seat.\nIn the afternoon, that chair \u0097 between Henry B. Eyring and Dieter F. Uchtdorf, his two counselors in the governing First Presidency \u0097 sat noticeably vacant.\nA spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said Monson, viewed by Mormons as a \"prophet, seer and revelator,\" was \"conserving his energy\" for the remainder of the weekend&apos;s sessions.\nMonson has led the 15.8 million-member church for more than nine years; Mormon presidents serve for life.\nTwo years ago, the Utah-based religion announced Monson was \"feeling the effects of advancing age.\" Since then, the longtime LDS leader, who also didn&apos;t attend last Saturday&apos;s women&apos;s meeting, has been scaling back his conference sermons.\nOther speakers had no trouble preaching with passion about current ills.\n\"Economic deprivation is a curse that keeps on cursing, year after year and generation after generation. It damages bodies, maims spirits, harms families, and destroys dreams,\" Holland said, decrying poverty and lamenting that \"so many around us suffer from mental and emotional illness or other debilitating health limitations.\"\nThe former president of LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University pleaded with members to stay in the faith&apos;s expanding fold.\n\"There is room for those who speak different languages, celebrate diverse cultures, and live in a host of locations. There is room for the single, the married, for large families and for the childless,\" he said. \"There is room for those who once had questions regarding their faith and room for those who still do. There is room for those with differing sexual attractions.\"\nIn short, Holland proclaimed, \"there is a place for everyone who loves God.\"\nFellow apostle Robert D. Hales said as Latter-day Saints follow Christ, \"there will be no disparity between the kindness we show our enemies and the kindness we bestow on our friends. We will be as honest when no one is looking at us as when others are watching. We will be as devoted to God in the public square as we are in our private closet.\"\nLike the parable of the good Samaritan, true believers \"cross the road to minister to whomever is in need, even if they are not within the circle of our friends,\" Hales said. \"We bless them that curse us. We do good to those who despitefully use us. Is any attribute more godly or Christlike?\"\nIn the morning, apostle Dale G. Renlund cautioned Mormons against railing on opponents.\n\"We must guard against bigotry that raises its ugly voice toward those who hold different opinions. Bigotry manifests itself, in part, in unwillingness to grant equal freedom of expression,\" he said. \"Everyone, including people of religion, has the right to express his or her opinions in the public square.\"\nRenlund, a physician by training, spent his teen years in Europe in the 1960s, where he felt \"picked on and bullied\" as an American, he said, \"as though I were personally responsible for unpopular foreign policies.\"\nDuring that time, he also witnessed the \"ugliness of prejudice and discrimination suffered by those who are targeted because of their race or ethnicity.\"\nIn LDS history, Mormons were persecuted for their faith, Renlund noted. \"How ironically sad it would be if we were to treat others as we have been treated. ... Let us fully mirror [Jesus&apos;] love and love one another so openly and completely that no one feels abandoned, alone or hopeless.\"\nEyring, who spoke first Saturday, addressed Mormons&apos; theological drive to seek out their ancestors \u0097 a practice they believe opens the door of the LDS gospel to long dead kin \u0097 and the growing fascination with genealogy among millions of others.\n\"Interest in exploring one&apos;s family history has grown exponentially. At ever-increasing rates, people seem drawn to their ancestry with more than just casual curiosity,\" he said. \"Genealogical libraries, associations and technologies have emerged around the world to support this interest.\"\nHe said the \"hearts of the children \u0097 you and me \u0097 have turned to our fathers, our ancestors. The affection you feel for your ancestors is ... deeply seated in your sense of who you are. But it has to do with more than just inherited DNA.\"\nThe morning&apos;s concluding speaker was Russell M. Nelson, senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and next in the line for the church presidency.\nNelson touted the power of faith to change lives.\n\"True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from people of the world,\" the 92-year-old leader said. Faith \"propels us to do things we otherwise would not do. Faith that motivates us to action gives us more access to his power.\"\nWhen believers \"reach up for the Lord&apos;s power ... with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air,\" Nelson promised, \"power from Jesus Christ will be yours. When the savior knows you truly want to reach up to him \u0097 when he can feel that the greatest desire of your heart is to draw his power into your life \u0097 you will be led by the Holy Ghost to know exactly what you need to do.\"\nIn the afternoon, apostle Neil L. Andersen emphasized the importance of \"overcoming the world,\" rising above earthly concerns and focusing on God.\n\"Overcoming the world is not a global invasion, but a private, personal battle, requiring hand-to-hand combat with our own internal foes,\" Andersen said. \"The world, on the other hand, is more interested in indulging the natural man than in subduing him.\"\nOne of those indulgences is social media. \"A disciple of Christ is not alarmed if a post about her faith does not receive 1,000 likes or even a few friendly emojis,\" Andersen said. \"Overcoming the world is less concerned with our online connections and more concerned with our heavenly connection to God.\"\nFellow apostle M. Russell Ballard advised the faithful to set goals for their lives and make plans to achieve them, \"within the framework of our Heavenly Father&apos;s eternal plan.\"\nThe most important aims, he", "baseline_completion": "said, are \"to return to [God&apos;s] presence and to receive the eternal blessings that come from making and keeping covenants.\"\nBallard warned about \"loud voices\" used by Satan \u0097 including the mass media, the internet and social media \u0097 \"that seek to drown out the small and still voice of the Holy Spirit that can show us &apos;all things&apos; we should do to return and receive.\"\n\"We must keep the doctrine and gospel of Jesus Christ at the center of our goals and plans,\" Ballard said. \"Without him, no eternal goal is possible, and our plans to achieve our eternal goals will surely fail.\"\nNo women spoke Saturday, but three new female leaders were named to lead the women&apos;s Relief Society.\nEditor David Noyce and reporter Sean P. Means contributed to this story.", "orig_sample_length": 2844, "prompt_length": 2644, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "said, \"are to obtain the highest degree of exaltation in the celestial kingdom and to be reunited with our family throughout eternity.\"\nBallard also spoke of a \"crisis of faith\" facing many Latter-day Saints. He noted that \"some of our young people, including some young men who are serving missions, are struggling with their faith.\" In addition, he said, \"some of our faithful investigators are raising questions about the Church&apos;s doctrine and practices.\"\n\"Whenever there is a crisis, there is a crossroads. There are two paths we can take,\" Ballard said. \"We can either give up our faith or we can stand firm in our faith and for our faith. ...\n\"We have not been given the mission of apologizing for the doctrine or practices of the Church, but rather we have been given the mission to share the doctrine and to practice the doctrine,\" he", "w_wm_output": "said, are \"to be faithful and obedient to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the commandments and covenants we have made in this holy temple.\"\nMormon scholar John Turner, a professor at University of California, Los Angeles, and an expert on the religion, was not surprised at the conference&apos;s content.\n\"For the most part, the conference was predictable,\" he said in a telephone interview Friday. \"It was a conservative message.\"\nHowever, the Salt Lake Tribune reported Friday, \"Mormons \u0097 including the LDS hierarchy \u0097 have watched with deep concern as the nation&apos;s polarized state mirrors a schism within the church over the future of the faith, which was founded more than a century and a half ago.\n\"For the first time,\" the Tribune reported, \"Mormons have publicly debated the future of the

{"idx": 424, "truncated_input": "Upbeat on plans: Girija Pande of TCS says the company\u2019s revenues from its Chinese operations will grow by around 45% in the next two years.\nHyderabad: With business from the US and Europe expected to decrease due to the ongoing financial turmoil, Indian information technology services (IT) firms are increasing their focus on the Asia Pacific region, particularly China, in an effort to tap the latter\u2019s IT market and use it as a strategic base to enter the at least $100 billion (Rs4.76 trillion)-a-year Japanese IT market.\nBusiness from the US and Europe together account for between 80% and 95% of revenues of the top five Indian IT services firms, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd or TCS, Infosys Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Satyam Computer Services Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.\nMarket research firm IDC estimates the Chinese IT services market to reach at least $55 billion by 2010.\nTCS entered China in 2002 with a software development and delivery center. While its initial objective was to serve its global clients having Chinese operations, the company has now started addressing the regional and local market. Currently, it has 1,300 employees working in China. In its latest annual report, TCS said its China operations had managed to break even.\nAccording to Girija Pande, executive vice-president and head of Asia Pacific division at TCS, the Chinese IT market is growing by at least 20% annually and revenue from the company\u2019s Chinese operations will grow by around 45% in the next two years.\n\u201cIn the short term, we will be expanding our presence and increasing the headcount to at least 5,000 by 2011,\" said Pande.\nSimilarly, Infosys has a 1,000-strong workforce in China and said it is in expansion mode. \u201cWe have expanded our operations in two cities Shanghai and Hangzhou,\" a company spokesperson said in an email response. The company\u2019s Chinese subsidiaries, however, were still loss-making as on 30 September, according to the company\u2019s second quarter results.\nSatyam admitted it is yet to make significant headway with its China operations but said it is in expansion mode with an eye on the long-term.\nThe company currently employs around 1,000 people in its two subsidiaries in China and plans to scale up headcount to nearly 2,000 by 2010. It is also investing in a training centre in China, which will have a capacity of at least 2,500 by 2010.\n\u201cIt is still a mystery why Indian companies have not been able to get any significant share of outsourced work from China and Japan,\" said Virender Aggarwal, head of rest of the world operations for Satyam.\nAnalysts acknowledge that China has been a rather difficult market for a variety of reasons.\n\u201cSo far, the Chinese domestic market has been one that is difficult to engage, primarily because of state and public sector dominance,\" said Milan Sheth, partner and head of IT outsourcing advisory at audit and consulting firm Ernst and Young. \u201cIt is critical to have a well connected and established Chinese local partner who can help penetrate that market,\" he said.\nTCS said it views China as a better base to address the Japanese market. \u201cA significant share of outsourced work from the Japanese market is cornered by Chinese companies, as they have a relative cultural and linguistic advantage over their Indian counterparts. We see being present in China as the first step in building the right relationships,\" said Pande.\nBoth TCS and Satyam are betting on local talent to succeed in their Chinese operations and help the company better address the local market as well as help build bridges with Japanese companies. At least 90% of TCS\u2019 workforce in China comprises local hires.\nNasscom\u2019s Som Mittal said that the size of the Japanese IT market and the potential for outs", "baseline_completion": "ourcing presents a huge opportunity for Indian IT firms, but, he added that the market has been relatively insulated due to language and cultural barriers. \u201cHowever, we see an increasing desire among Japanese companies for sourcing competitively priced IT services from foreign companies.

On Saturday, he and the other members of the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players will perform ''Iolanthe,'' a satire set in a fairyland, at the Palace Theater in Stamford.\nAs a ''patter'' man, Mr. Reed must speak lines that are exercises in rapid-fire phonetics.\n''It's just fast and furious,'' said Mr. Reed, a native of northern England who now splits his career between Britain and the United States.\nOne of the most famous patter songs in the Gilbert and Sullivan repertory is ''The Nightmare Song'' from ''Iolanthe,'' which he performs.\n''It goes on forever,'' Mr. Reed said.\n''Iolanthe'' will treat lovers of breathless buffoonery to not one but three such exercises in elocution, all performed by Mr. Reed.\nMr. Reed has to have impeccable diction to get the lyrics across to the audience. And every single note has to be right. But in 1951, when he joined the famous D'Oyly Carte Company in London, which was founded in 1878 by Richard D'Oyly Carte, the producer of the first operas by William S. Gilbert and Arthur S. Sullivan, things were different.\nBut by 1959, Mr. Reed had taken over all the company's comedic roles.

That is where he met Mr. Bergeret, and they have performed together several times since.\nNow Mr. Reed spends half his time performing and the other half directing.

Now, he said, the operas are considered ''serious'' and ''intellectual.''\nMr. Reed retired from the company in 1968.

{"idx": 428, "truncated_input": "The Moto Z2 Play and Z2 Force give you maximum customization at a minimal price.\nWiredYou won't find mods as useful or well-designed on other phones. Motorola's gestures are handy. Fantastic battery life, especially on the Moto Z2 Play. Storage is expandable via MicroSD.\nTiredWhere's the waterproofing? The Z2 Force has no headphone jack. The best Moto Mods are pricey, as are these phones. The cameras are acceptable, but still need work.\nA lot of Android phones claim to be different, but Motorola\u2019s Z series backs up that claim. Love \u2018em or hate \u2018em, the Moto Z phones have something that other phones just don\u2019t. The new Moto Z2 Force and Moto Z2 Play have magnetic Mods that snap onto the back of them, adding new features. What you think about those Mods will determine whether either of the two Moto Z2 phones are right for you.\nWhatever you\u2019re doing, Moto wants to have a Mod for that. Snap on a battery pack if you\u2019re going off grid, or maybe a 360-degree camera so you can capture everything on that nature hike. Pop on a speaker and you can pump up the jams, or attach Motorola\u2019s brand new Polaroid printer Mod that lets you instantly print out any photo you take. You can even buy a Mod that turns your phone into an Amazon Echo speaker, complete with a glowing blue ring.\nThere are more than a dozen of these Mods, and they all magnetically cling to the back of the rather svelte Z2, which feels almost too thin and flat without one. Moto Mods are the defining reason to buy a Moto Z2 Play and its more expensive sibling, the Z2 Force. But they don\u2019t come cheap. Many of these doodads cost upward of a hundred bucks.\nMy Moto Z2s have worn a lot of Mods in the last few weeks. I found most of them fun, but I didn\u2019t want to keep any of them snapped on forever. Many of them make the phone a little too fat. My favorite was a battery pack, which I kept in my back and snapped on whenever I had a long day ahead of me. Oddly, I rarely needed it. Both the Z2 Force and Play get excellent battery life without augmentation. I was able to use the Z2 Play for two days straight after forgetting to charge it, though it was gasping for a charge by the second evening. That kind of battery life is hard to come by these days.\nBoth Moto Z2 phones are nearly identical from the outside. They have large glass 5.5-inch screens above a nice fingerprint sensor. The sides and back are smooth, brushed aluminum with a large circular bump for the rear camera. Ridges on the power button make it easy to distinguish from the volume keys, all of which sit on the right side of the phone. Charging via the USB C slot on the bottom is also pretty standard.\nInitially, I was bothered by how flat the back of the phone feels. It doesn\u2019t contour to your palm like some phones. After a few days, I got used to it and now appreciate how thin these phones feel, though I still recommend a bumper case, like this one from Lenovo.\nSetting aside the lack of waterproofing on either phone, the only problem with the design is that it\u2019s large for one-handed use. This is an extra-large phone, and if that bothers you, consider the smaller and cheaper Moto X4.\nBoth phones also run Motorola\u2019s slight twist on Android 7 Nougat (the new Android 8 Oreo is promised, but not out yet). Most of what\u2019s here is identical to other Android phones, but there are a few Moto Action gestures that I like to use. You can twist the phone to open the camera and swipe it down and up like you\u2019re swinging an ax to turn on and off the flashlight. Even better are the home button gestures, which let you dump the onscreen back, home, and multitasking buttons in favor of swiping left, right, and pressing on the home button. It takes a good day to get used to it, but swiping is very intuitive, and a great reason to stick with a phone with a home button fingerprint sensor, like this one.\nThe 12-megapixel rear cameras perform similarly, as well. I snapped some lovely night photos on a trip to New York City, and the camera did a decent job balancing dark areas and bright Christmas light displays at Saks Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Center. The Moto Z2 Play has been my go-to camera for three weeks now. Despite what feels like a second of lag when pressing the shutter button, it hasn\u2019t hampered my ability to take timely shots. The 5-megapixel front camera on each is decent, but has had some trouble in low-light situations. The rear camera\u2019s 4K (30fps) video support is also nice. If you\u2019re picky about your photos though, neither of these can match the shooters on the new iPhone X or Pixel 2.\nBoth Z2 models will work on most wireless carriers, have 64GB storage (with MicroSD slots), and 4GB of RAM. Still, there are a few vital differences between these phones that I\u2019m going to sum up quickly.\nThe Z2 Force is the fancier $720 version. It has an extra rear camera (that, to be honest, does not add a whole lot to the experience), a cutting-edge Snapdragon 835 processor (this does speed the phone up substantially if you use intense apps or games), and a higher-resolution Quad HD screen that will supposedly withstand falls better. It also comes with a \"Shattershield\" screen cover stuck on it that\u2019s sharp around the edges. What you lose is a headphone jack and a few hours of battery life. It\u2019s also imperceptibly thicker.\nThe Moto Z2 Play has a weaker Snapdragon 626 processor, larger battery, FM radio, and standard HD screen. I was legitimately shocked when I found out both screens had a different resolution, which shows just how adequate a 1080p screen still is. Both Super A", "baseline_completion": "MOLED displays look excellent.\nI still like having a headphone jack and the slightly slower performance of the Moto Z2 Play is an easy tradeoff for the savings. The $500 64GB Unlocked version of the Moto Z2 Play is my favorite model (linked in the Buy buttons on this review), though there is a Verizon-only edition for $408.\nThere are a few truly high-end phones you can buy for $500 or less, like the OnePlus 5T or Essential Phone, but neither of them have Moto Mods. That\u2019s the reason to choose a Moto Z phone.\nThe 64GB Unlocked Moto Z2 Play is a fantastic phone, if Moto Mods interest you. If they don\u2019t, I can\u2019t help but direct you to the other Moto in the room, the Moto X4.", "orig_sample_length": 1659, "prompt_length": 1459, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "MOLED displays have good contrast and colors, and each is protected by Gorilla Glass 3.\nThe Z2 Play is the slightly better deal at $499, but the Z2 Force is the phone you\u2019ll want to splurge on if you\u2019re serious about photography or performance.\nBoth phones are supported by 32-bit Moto Mods, which will only work until December 2019. After that, they won\u2019t be supported, and you\u2019ll have to buy new Mods. It\u2019s a shitty way for Motorola to communicate this, and I\u2019m not sure why it did it. 32-bit support was already pushed back to the end of 2018 when the Moto Mods platform launched in 2016, so it makes no sense to do it again.\nWhere\u2019s the waterproofing? The Z2 Force has", "w_wm_output": "MOLED screens have deep blacks and good color. I can\u2019t really tell a difference in picture sharpness or viewing angles.

{"idx": 430, "truncated_input": "If you tuned out the fourth quarter of the biggest blowout win by the Giants in four years, then you might have missed the entire body of work for rookie Kyle Lauletta.\nThe Giants demoted and deactivated their rookie quarterback to No. 3 on the depth chart and activated veteran Alex Tanney against his former team Sunday as the Titans visited rainy MetLife Stadium.\nEli Manning and Tanney had been the Giants' top two quarterbacks for the first 11 games before the Giants flip-flopped Lauletta and Tanney two games ago. Lauletta did not play against the Bears but made his NFL debut with a 40-0 fourth-quarter lead against the Redskins.\nLauletta went 0-for-5 with an interception as the Giants won 40-16.\nRookie quarterback Kyle Lauletta debuted for Giants in the 40-16 blowout win against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, December 9, 2018 (12/9/18) at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. His teammates and Richmond coaches say there is much more coming than the box score showed.\nThe Giants did not hide their disappointment with Lauletta after the game.\n\"I don't think we had enough there to evaluate how he did,\" coach Pat Shurmur said after the game. \"I would've liked a couple more completions and to not throw that interception, certainly.\n\"We felt like, 'OK, let's take a look at him and see.' I fielded enough questions regarding Kyle Lauletta that we were interested in seeing him. Hopefully, you got a chance to see what you were looking for.\"\nIf the true reason the Giants were interested in seeing him was because of the amount of media questions about him in the weeks when the team started 1-7, that is troubling.\nAfter all, they used a fourth-round pick on Lauletta when an offensive tackle, pass-rusher or cornerback could've helped immediately.\nIf the Giants feel Lauletta is far off being able to play in a game, that is more of a question of the pick than of the people asking if he should be inserted into a game during a lost season, especially considering Giants owner John Mara saying it was a mistake not to play a rookie quarterback (Davis Webb) last season.\nShurmur said Wednesday that Lauletta was the No. 2 quarterback but subject to change. He also declined to commit to a backup quarterback when asked Friday.\nAsked if he saw anything encouraging from Lauletta beyond the box score, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Shula succinctly said, \"Yeah, he got experience.\"\nThe Giants still are alive in the NFC playoff race and can't be eliminated this weekend if they beat the Titans. A loss sp", "baseline_completion": "ells elimination.\nWill the Giants re-open the door for Lauletta under those circumstances? Shurmur admitted more evaluation is needed, but Lauletta is going the wrong way on the depth chart, rather than nipping at Manning's heels to be the starter in 2019.\nManning has stepped up his play of late, with the Giants offense averaging more than 28 points per game during a 4-1 stretch over the last five games.\nThe purpose of the switch back to Tanney is unclear, though Shurmur does like having a veteran quarterback as a backup on gamedays.\nOnce he made the move to Lauletta, however, he is risking shaken confidence for a rookie handling a setback with seemingly little to gain because the Giants will not bench Manning and he is as injury-proof as any NFL quarterback ever.", "orig_sample_length": 878, "prompt_length": 678, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ells a playoff elimination.\nBut the Giants know they can't expect Lauletta to come in and perform on the big stage.\n\"The answer is no,\" Shurmur said bluntly when asked if he'd be comfortable with Lauletta in a playoff game. \"But you want to see him play. He hasn't played. We'll see what he does.\n\"I'm not going to put anybody out there that I don't think can do it. But I'm not going to put anybody out there that I think is going to get hurt. We're not there yet.\"\nIf they thought Lauletta was close, they would have put him in the game.\n\"I'm not going to put anybody out there that I don't think can do it.\"\nPat Shurmur on Kyle Lauletta\nBut the Giants have struggled to evaluate Lauletta", "w_wm_output": "ells almost certain elimination, and the Giants can't afford to have a quarterback who is a \"yes\" or \"no\" for the postseason.\n\"We\u2019re going to see where it goes as we finish up the season,\" Shurmur said. \"You\u2019re dealing with a lot of factors with a young guy playing for the first time.

She says nothing, because what else is there to say? This is a show about Kathy Bates working in a dispensary, and that\u2019s more than enough to get people interested.\n[Disjointed] follows Ruth (Bates), a lifelong advocate for legalization, as she finally lives her dream as the owner of an Los Angeles cannabis dispensary. Joining her at Ruth\u2019s Alternative Caring are three charismatic \u201cbudtenders\u201d (Dougie Baldwin, Elizabeth Ho and Elizabeth Alderfer), her entrepreneurial twentysomething son (Aaron Moten) and a very troubled security guard who served in Afghanistan (Tone Bell).\nAll 20 episodes of Disjointed will be released on Netflix August 25.", "orig_sample_length": 293, "prompt_length": 93, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ", Bates and her canine sidekick Pinky discuss smoking in public and the hassles that come with it.\nThe series, which will consist of eight episodes, will follow Bates as her cannabis dispensary is threatened by the city\u2019s new anti-pot movement.\nBates will also star in a comedy pilot called The Kicks for ABC Family, which follows a teenage soccer player who has to move in with her father and his girlfriend, a former Olympic star.\nWatch the first teaser for Disjointed below.", "w_wm_output": ", the main characters can be seen in various stages of their daily routine. One is playing a video game with a bong-toting bear; the other is dancing with a chicken.\nSure, this may not sound like a particularly funny show, but the premise is definitely intriguing.

{"idx": 433, "truncated_input": "The Solar Decathlon is a wonderful idea, where teams from all over the world compete to design the most energy-efficient buildings which are, of course, solar powered. Most have tended to be the size of mobile homes, so that they can be built at the universities and shipped to the decathlon, and then shipped home. Most entries act like mobile homes, being detached buildings that will stand alone.\nThe DPD is a uniquely syncretic product of our study of two proven traditional housing typologies born of different cultures. The row house typology, typical of Montreal\u2019s urban fabric, accommodates single-family scenarios in a long and narrow low-rise form. The Siheyuan courtyard house demonstrates an environmentally and culturally specific approach to city dwelling of great historic, social, and functional value.\nThe DPD is also designed to the Passive House standard, which can be a challenge in a city like Montreal; there is a reason that an unofficial anthem for Quebec is Gilles Vigneault\u2019s \u201cMon pays, ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver\u201d (My country is not a country, it's winter). So it has a lot of insulation, an energy recovery ventilation system, and is designed for serious air-tightness. I looked in vain to see who the Passive House consultants were but see that they are \u201cusing passive design and construction principles\u201d to design \u201ca net-zero energy capable dwelling\u201d. A press release says that it is a \u201cPassive House-inspired design\u201d.\nAnother feature of the house is that it is prefabricated.\nA key innovation of the DPD is the utilization of off-site (factory) prefabrication methods of construction. It is designed for both modular & panelized options. Prefabrication addresses issues of affordability, reduction of waste, health and safety of workers, greater export capacity, and quality control to achieve high-performance building standards. Quebec\u2019s prefabrication industry is one of the most robust in North America and its expansion into the high-performance building industry is a key to its development.\nBut they are not doing Passive House quality prefabs in Quebec yet, so the team turned to Ecocor in Maine, which builds houses from Passive House quality panels. Chris Corson, founder and President of Ecocor tells TreeHugger that there was nobody in the Province who could deliver this and having seen Ecocor\u2019s work at the North American Passive House Network conference last year I can believe it, these are closer to cabinetry than wall panels. They had to be modified so that they could be easily taken apart in Montreal and reassembled in China, and the insulation was changed from Corson\u2019s preferred, cellulose, to what everyone in Canada loves (it\u2019s made there), Roxul rock wool.\nIt has all the smart home stuff, including \u201cSensor networks and Internet of Things technologies installed throughout the home for performance and durability monitoring, consumption, and automation.\u201d But with that much insulation", "baseline_completion": ", and being a townhouse with neighbours on either side, it is also what I like to call a dumb home- it is resilient in the face of power outages, and could keep people warm and safe for weeks.\nTeamMTL\u2019s goal is to employ socially, culturally and technologically advanced architecture that embodies energy efficiency, comfort, wellbeing, affordability, environmental sustainability and ecological awareness. Sustainable building starts with quality construction and design, and Ecocor\u2019s 21st Century, prefab approach to building the most energy efficient homes on the market today helped us reach our objectives.\nIt really does press all the buttons; small, urban design built with the most sophisticated prefab technologies to the highest standards of energy efficiency and comfort. Most solar decathlon designs are one-offs but I hope this one gets multiple printings.", "orig_sample_length": 886, "prompt_length": 686, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "it will be a little slow to heat up. The DPD team says \u201cAccording to our simulation and the building\u2019s thermal model, it will take approximately 20 minutes to reach the desired internal temperature of 22\u00b0C when the HRV is running at full speed\u201d.\nThe team is looking for a buyer for this house who will take it home and, as they say, \u201cLet it shine\u201d.\nIf you are interested in this, and live in Montreal, here\u2019s an email address: dpd.team@concordia.ca.

{"idx": 434, "truncated_input": "For more than a decade, Daveyton's Mayor, Tom Boya, was Pretoria's evidence of the legitimacy of the municipal councils running its segregated black townships.\nAs president of the United Municipalities of South Africa, an organization of black municipal officials, Mr. Boya put aside his mayoral duties and traveled as far afield as the United States and Brazil to discourse on the concerns of local government.\nBut he recently stunned a crowd of 80,000 residents of Daveyton by announcing that he was quitting his posts. He said the system with which he had become identified had no future. Whether motivated by conscience or survival, his unexpected resignation elicited wild cheers and seemed to signal the beginning of the end for black township governments.\nMr. Boya, who is 39 years old, said the handwriting appeared on the wall after the African National Congress was made legal and Nelson Mandela released in February. \"I realized there was no room any more for a person to serve in a structure created by the Government,\" he said.\nHis decision to quit, he said, was prompted by his inability to stop the state-owned power company from switching off Daveyton's electricity for four days recently because of unpaid bills. He said it illustrated the frustrations he had faced in Daveyton since joining its town council in 1978.\n\"The weakness of the black local authorities was simply lack of funds, lack of local sources of revenue,\" Mr. Boya said. But, he quickly added, \"the structures were illegitimate\" because the white minority Government had imposed them on blacks.\nTheir resources are not shared with the satellite black townships, which began as stark dormitories for blacks working at menial jobs in white areas and which suffer chronic poverty and unemployment.\nAnti-apartheid civic associations have organized boycotts of rent and utility payments to protest inferior living conditions, which deprive municipal governments of the modest revenue upon which they depend. The associations have accused municipal officials like Mr. Boya of being puppets of apartheid.\nSatisfied that the crisis had been resolved, Mr. Boya flew to Rio de Janeiro for a conference. In his absence, the deal collapsed when the Transvaal Provincial Administration insisted that most of the money paid go to pay municipal wages and only a little to the utility company. He returned home to find the electricity turned off and his constituents irate.\n\"I felt so lonely,\" Mr. Boya said. \"I felt rejected. I felt betrayed.\"\nThe electricity was turned back on after residents took the utility company to court.\nMr. Boya's foreboding about the future of black local government was heightened when he went to a United Municipalities conference recently and found only 8 of its 60 municipal councils represented.\nMr. Boya said he went to the other rally and decided to quit. \"You could have heard a pin when I went over to the podium,\" he said. \"I then offered my resignation.\"\nJames Ngubo, chairman of the Daveyton Interim Committee said that \"Mr. Boya coming out really symbolizes that the system", "baseline_completion": "is bankrupt.\" He said the white minority Government had set up Mr. Boya as a \"good black man\" to make black local authorities palatable. His group had pressed Mr. Boya to resign, Mr. Ngubo said, and the power cuts \"must have been the last straw for him.\"\nFour other Daveyton councillors have followed Mr. Boya's example.\nMr. Boya predicted the inevitable collapse of all township government structures. \"I think it will be very healthy when it happens,\" he said. \"From those ruins, we can build.\"\nHe said municipalites must encompass white and black communities together and pool their revenue. And municipalities, he said, should be defined by region instead of race.\n\"The Government should abolish black local authorities and white local authorities and call for an election of local authorities under one umbrella,\" he said.", "orig_sample_length": 927, "prompt_length": 727, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "is finished.\"\nA version of this article appears in print on March 30, 1990, on Page B00004 of the National edition with the headline: Black Mayor Quits; Symbol of Resistance to Apartheid.

{"idx": 435, "truncated_input": "ZTE, Huawei: Can China ever become a true innovation powerhouse? A Future Tense event.\nWill China\u2019s Scientists and Technologists Ever Be Truly Innovative?\nFrom left: Adam Segal, Denis Simon, Yifei Sun, and Steve LeVine.\nJust this week, a House of Representatives committee issued a report warning the United States against doing business with two major Chinese tech firms, ZTE and Huawei. The companies were closely tied to the Chinese government, the report said, and could be stealing information from the U.S. government and American businesses.\nIn opening remarks, Steve LeVine, Washington correspondent for Quartz magazine and a Bernard L. Schwartz fellow, established the questions for the day: Can China ever become an \u201cinnovation juggernaut,\u201d just as it is a world leader in manufacturing? Does \u201cinnovation\u201d have to mean breakthroughs, or is incremental innovation\u2014small tweaks on Western-made technology to make it cheaper and sometimes better\u2014enough? And should the rest of the world be worried?\n-Creativity isn\u2019t encouraged: Segal argued that while we focus on the \u201chardware\u201d\u2014the more tangible results of innovation, like patents filed\u2014China needs to focus on the \u201csoftware\u201d problems of culture. In China, researchers aren\u2019t urged to think creatively, nor do they feel free to fail. \u201cNo risk, no reward\u201d may be a clich\u00e9, but it is also a truism.\n-Quantity is valued over quality: According to Huang, the number of journal articles published by Chinese researchers has exploded in recent years. But outside of the life sciences and biology, the level of impact from this research has remained fairly flat\u2014indicating that the research is not high-quality. In part, this may be because researchers are paid per publication, so repetitive research and short-term work is incentivized.\n-Intellectual property rights are not respected: Since patents and copyrights are frequently violated, there is less incentive to create.\nChina\u2019s leadership understands all of these things, said Segal. In fact, they have probably visited Silicon Valley \u201cmore than anyone,\u201d he joked. Accordingly, China\u2019s 2006 mid- to long-term plan for science and technology development emphasized the need for better intellectual property protection, for startup culture. But politically, introducing these elements will be very difficult\u2014especially, as Simon noted, because the politicians have other significant worries on their minds, like domestic protests. Still, they understand that the \u201ctransition to a knowledge economy\u201d is critical, and accordingly they want to be the No. 1 or No. 2 country in the world for innovation by 2049\u2014China\u2019s centennial. That\u2019s one reason why they are expanding investment into R&D, going from 1 percent of", "baseline_completion": "GDP for a long time to 2 percent of GDP in 2011. But China isn\u2019t doing this only for financial reasons, according to Segal\u2014the country also wants not to have to depend on the West for its technological and scientific needs.\nThere are some positive signs here for China. For instance, Simon said that more and more research funding is coming in at the local level, not from the national government\u2014a \u201csystemic change,\u201d he termed it. And while many Western companies opened their research labs in China initially because the government effectively made it a condition for selling goods in the country, said Sun, they are increasingly producing interesting work. No breakthroughs yet, he acknowledged, but they may come soon. China\u2019s most successful fields\u2014nanotechnology, life sciences, biology\u2014are those that have been open to international collaboration.\nWatch the entire event on the New America Foundation website.", "orig_sample_length": 861, "prompt_length": 661, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "GDP to 2.4 percent by 2025. But changes have yet to trickle down, said Huang, and the system still rewards quantity over quality, and researchers are still under pressure to publish.\n-American businesses should be wary: Huawei has had its phone business successfully cut off by the U.S. government, said Huang, but they are preparing for the worst: \u201cThey\u2019re diversifying their businesses, they\u2019re investing in networks.\u201d And more worryingly, they\u2019re investing in innovation, said Segal: In 2013, the company had 50,000 patent applications filed, more than any other company in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a party that we can\u2019t ignore,\u201d said LeVine.\n-Software is key: While China has its own version of Microsoft (Softbank), Segal says that", "w_wm_output": "their GDP in the 1980s to more than 2 percent in 2006.\nBut as many of the speakers pointed out, the Chinese government has a difficult time accepting that China might not achieve this goal.

{"idx": 441, "truncated_input": "WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal regulators voted Wednesday to require companies to reveal more information about how they pay their executives amid a public outcry over compensation.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-to-1 to expand the disclosure requirements for public companies.\nCompany policies that encouraged excessive risk-taking and rewarded executives for delivering short-term profits were blamed for fueling the financial crisis.\nThe SEC also changed a formula that critics say allowed companies to understate how much their senior executives are paid. At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings. Such awards often make up most of top executives' pay.\nThe new requirements include information on how a company's pay policies might encourage too much risk-taking.\nSeparately, the agency voted unanimously to require thousands of investment advisers who have custody of clients' money to submit to annual surprise exams by outside auditors.\nThe surprise audits would allow independent accountants to review the books and verify that the money is there. The snap audits would apply to about 1,600 investment advisers that don't use third-party custodians, out of roughly 11,000 advisers registered with the SEC.\nThis move is aimed at plugging gaps that allowed disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff to deceive investors.\nThe expanded executive pay disclosure rules will take effect next spring, when companies send annual proxy disclosures to shareholders.\nThe changes will help investors make better-informed voting decisions for the companies in which they hold stock, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said.\n\"By adopting these rules, we will improve the disclosure around risk, compensation and corporate governance, thereby increasing accountability and directly benefiting investors,\" Schapiro said before the vote.\nBut Commissioner Kathleen Casey said she opposed some of the new requirements, such as added information on qualifications of directors and candidates for the board, that she said could be \"unduly burdensome.\"\nAs a result, Casey said she was voting against the rule as a whole.\nIt was the first final rule adopted by the SEC this year under Schapiro's tenure. Numerous proposals have been made by the commissioners.\n\u2014Legal actions involving the company's executive officers, directors and nominees for the board.\n\u2014The role played by diversity as a factor in choosing candidates for the board.\n\u2014Potential conflicts of interest on the part of compensation consultants retained by the company.\nThe Obama administration imposed pay curbs on banks that received federal bailout money. Since then, eight of the largest such banks have either repaid or said they will repay their federal money, largely to escape caps on executive pay.\nThe Federal Reserve has set a February deadline for the 28 biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. \u2014 for submitting 2010 compensation plans. The Fed also will be encouraging, though not requiring, banks to revise this year's pay plans if they are out of step with principles the Fed has proposed to limit risk.\nAnger over lavish Wall Street pay has led some U.S. banks to take pre-emptive action. Goldman Sachs, for example, has said it won't give cash bonuses to 30 top executives. Instead, the bonuses will be paid in stock that can't be cashed in for five years.\nCompanies will have to disclose how pay is determined in departments involved in the riskiest activities \u2014 or departments that produce a big chunk of company profits.\nThe new requirements were proposed by the SEC and opened to public comment in July. They", "baseline_completion": "build on rules the agency adopted in 2006.\nUnder current rules, companies don't have to reveal the full value of stock options they give an executive. Instead, they must disclose in their annual proxy statements only the portion of an options award that vests that year.\nThe new rule will require companies to show in a summary table the estimated value of all stock-based awards on the day they are granted. The SEC's 2006 rules had relegated those totals to a separate table that investors often overlook or find hard to decipher.\nAn example is the case of a company that decides its CEO deserves $10 million worth of stock options, to vest in equal installments over four years. Under current rules, the company would have to include only $2.5 million \u2014 one-fourth of the total of the $10 million total \u2014 in the summary table.", "orig_sample_length": 1082, "prompt_length": 882, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "are intended to give investors more information on how a company's compensation practices might encourage too much risk-taking.\nThe rules also require companies to include a table if they grant stock awards with performance goals.

{"idx": 445, "truncated_input": "The black, glossy background in the Nike store took attention away from the brand's shoes.\nIn February, I visited Nike and Adidas' flagship stores in New York City.\nNike's displays were confusing, and the store didn't do enough to highlight the striking visuals that have always been one of the company's strengths.\nAdidas' design instincts were much better, and the store found a number of smart ways to allow customers to interact with products.\nThe rivalry between Nike and Adidas has been one of the top stories in athletic apparel for decades. While Nike has often landed bigger athletes for sponsorships, Adidas has surged in recent years by anticipating and responding to customer demand with stylish, versatile products that make sense for exercise or everyday use.\nNow, Nike is rethinking its retail approach in an attempt to keep Adidas from overtaking it as the top-selling athletic apparel company in the United States.\nI started at Niketown on 5th Avenue. Niketown was previously Nike's flagship store in New York City, but it closed in the spring and was replaced by a new store in November.\nThe first floor played to Nike's strengths.\nNike's acclaimed print and television ads have long played up its eye for striking visuals. Niketown's first floor reflected that skill set by highlighting images rather than products, creating excitement before customers even saw any merchandise.\nIt also promoted an inclusive, culturally relevant message. Nike's \"Equality\" ad campaign promoted diversity and tolerance.\nMost of the products shown on the first floor were inspired by that message. The items associated with the \"Equality\" campaign were some of the best I saw in the store.\nUnfortunately, the product displays (and many of the products themselves) on the other floors didn't quite live up to the hype. The store didn't have a consistent aesthetic, and many of the displays failed to highlight \u2014 and sometimes even detracted from \u2014 Nike's products.\nThe glossy black background on this display drew attention to its reflective qualities rather than the shoes.\nBasketball shoes have long been one of Nike's signature products, but Nike made some confusing decisions with its basketball shoe displays.\nPlacing a shoe off-center in the middle of a net-less basketball rim made the shoe line designed for LeBron James \u2014 perhaps Nike's most recognizable American athlete who isn't retired \u2014 look cheap rather than aspirational.\nIt didn't help that many of the shoes themselves were unattractive.\nIt would be difficult to make the raised, scale-like texture on Nike's \"Lebron 15\" shoe line look desirable in any environment. Considering the clout that Air Jordans still have with sneaker enthusiasts, it's surprising how badly Nike missed the mark with products associated with an athlete who will likely become one of the brand's most legendary icons.\nOne of Niketown's biggest problems was that it didn't consistently take advantage of Nike's best assets.\nThroughout its history, Nike has been able to land elite athletes for sponsorships more consistently than its competitors. But Niketown didn't do enough to highlight those athletes. This Lebron James display was a step in the right direction, but it wasn't reflected in the store's overall strategy.\nSome displays hinted at a strategy the store should have adopted.\nThis display for soccer shoes did a great job of creating an environment where the products could stand out, while complementing the products with eye-catching visuals of elite athletes. If Nike had applied this formula throughout the store, it may have been more compelling.\nBut more often than not, Nike wasted opportunities to show off the qualities that make it stand out from its competitors. I was drawn to the framed, black-and-white photos on each floor, but they were placed near the elevators and away from the merchandise.\nI went to Adidas' Fifth Avenue store next. Adidas opened the 45,000-square-foot store in December 2016.\nAdidas' flagship store also had a notable entrance. The Adidas store was designed with sports stadiums in mind, and the entrance was meant to look like the tunnel some athletes walk through before games. Like Niketown, the Adidas' store's entrance emphasized design over product.\nThe Adidas store had a more subtle and effective strategy for showing off its products, often placing shoes against walls with muted colors and using small, rectangular posters to separate the shoes into smaller groups that were easy to visually process.\nThe products were better, too. Adidas has gained an edge on competitors with its \"lifestyle running\" shoes, which are more stylish than the typical running shoe and are often worn as fashion accessories.\nNo matter their purpose, Adidas' shoes looked way better than anything Nike had to offer, often using sleeker designs, more sensible color schemes, and versatile textures that made sense for exercise and everyday use.\nThe store also highlighted the customer's ability to customize its products.\nThe second floor had a section that appealed to more creative types. Situated in the middle of the floor, the custom-design display wasn't intrusive, but it was obvious enough to draw the attention of a customer who might be interested in designing a custom shoe.\nCustomers could then make and order their own designs in the store.\nThe computers weren't quite as intuitive as they could be \u2014 they didn't indicate that users were supposed to scroll down at the beginning instead of clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the screen \u2014 but they were a smart way to engage customers who liked the brand's designs but weren't entirely satisfied with the color combinations available in the store.\nThe store also emphasized interactivity in creative ways.\nRather than only using a treadmill for customers who wanted to try out shoes (there was a treadmill available on the bottom floor), the second floor had a test track where customers could use clip-on sensors that would analyze their strides and allow salespeople to give them customized recommendations. The track was a smart way to encourage customers to reach out to salespeople, rather than the other way around.\nThe store allowed customers test out products in non-running contexts as well. On the bottom floor, a testing area with soccer balls and other sports equipment let customers get a sense of how products might work in sport-specific contexts.\nBetween the first and second floors, there were two sets of bleachers where people could watch sports while their", "baseline_completion": "friends, family members, or significant others shopped.\nBy integrating the bleachers into the staircase, they gave non-shoppers a place to hang out without getting in the way of customers.\nOverall, Adidas was the clear winner.\nI've preferred Nike to Adidas products for most of my life, so I was surprised by how impressed I was by the Adidas store. While it wasn't quite as flashy as its entrance indicated, it excelled where it mattered: in smart, carefully designed product displays and creative spaces where customers could test products in a wide variety of contexts. Add in the fact that Adidas has a significant edge on Nike in product design, and the result wasn't close.\nNike may still be the top-selling apparel brand in the US, but if it doesn't step up, Adidas could overtake it in the coming decades.", "orig_sample_length": 1732, "prompt_length": 1532, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "friends or family members tried out shoes.\nThe store was clean and comfortable, and it had a welcoming vibe.

The store will reopen next month.\nI visited the store when it was closed, and I was able to get a look at its interior.\nThe store will be smaller than Nike's previous location.\nThe new store will be more than 20% smaller because it's located in a different building.

It didn't just sell products and take their money \u2014 it wanted to create a community where people could bond over a shared interest.\nIt was a much more natural experience than the Nike store on the same floor. Nike's store was deeply aestheticized, but the way it was displayed made it difficult to see the details that made the shoes look good.\nIt was a much more natural experience than the Nike store on the same floor.

Palestinian children are detained without charge for months and when charged, they are tried in military courts. Gazan schools are insufficient and the funds often cut. An Israeli museum is built over a centuries old Muslim graveyard. Ancient olive trees, the livelihood of Palestinian farmers are burned. Homes are bulldozed. A blockade prevents goods from coming into and out of Palestine, inhibiting commerce and the means for a livelihood. Water is diverted from its source directly to Israel where it is abundantly available, including for swimming pools, while Palestinians have to buy water from tanker trucks.

A few rockets a week fall into north Israel and if they hit an Israeli citizen, Israel attacks with an over-the-top force, killing hundreds of Palestinians. Palestinians have only stones, and now knives, to express their frustration and anger.\nThose who support Israel based on religious beliefs do not realize that Palestine Christians also suffer under the burden of the Israeli occupation. The Presbyterian Church of America, and The Episcopal Peace Fellowship have spoken out about the repression in their book and DVD called, \u201cSteadfast Hope\u201d for their parishioners. It is painful to watch and read.\nPalestinian student campus organizations face bureaucratic harassment, severe restrictions on and censorship of their columns, even cancellations of their speakers. If they do win the battle to publish their viewpoint, Jewish organizations immediately spring into action to overwhelmingly deny and refute their message.\nMovies, media and games perpetuate stereotypes with Palestinians depicted as terrorists and villains, vicious gunmen, wide-eyed maniacs killing anyone, anywhere, any time for any", "baseline_completion": "reason.

A major conference, \u201cThe Israel Lobby: Is It Good for the US, Is It Good for Israel?\u201d received no main stream media coverage.\nHow to get the message out? Jewish organizations inside Israel and the U.S. are working for peace and to let the world know of the suffering of the Palestinians.

The U.S. government provides Israel with $3.8 billion a year in military aid.\nIn my view, there are a couple of things that can be done to change this situation. First, we should divest from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation, and this includes non-profit organizations that do not want to appear controversial and so they do not act.\nSecond, we need to speak out, and specifically I think we need to raise the issue at the university.

A refugee camp was built in Gaza where the refugees could wait out the end of the hostilities until they could return to their homes.\nFrom the 1948 creation of Israel up through the 1967 War, the Israelis invaded Egypt and took the West Bank, which was controlled by Jordan at the time.

He went down Saturday in one car and his parents in another.\n\u2014 Even with a GPS, things don\u2019t always work out as planned. His mother and I headed down Interstate 81 and then I-40 toward Nashville. He ended up taking I-75 toward Chattanooga at the I-81 and I-40 split east of Knoxville. However, his phone GPS directed him a different way after his southern turn and he beat us there by at least 20 minutes.\n\u2014 If you travel with a gumball machine, don\u2019t put the gumballs in until you get to your destination without a top on the machine. My ex\u2019s rear floorboard was full of gumballs before we left Kingsport.\n\u2014 If you ever make a trip to Murfreesboro, when you make the exit off I-40 to I-840, be forewarned there are no gas stations until you reach Murfreesboro, about 22 miles. We realized this as the gas gauge was about on empty. On much of I-40 there are gas stations galore, often at every exit.\n\u2014 Once we got to Mufreesboro and then campus, we relied more heavily on GPS to guide us since we weren\u2019t familiar with the campus or the city. After the third time of being directed to turn left onto Mount Sue Boulevard, I realized the GPS meant MTSU Boulevard. Hmm, Big Blue of Mount Sue? At least it rhymes.\n\u2014 Always check to be sure the dorm refrigerator works and have a checklist of items. After his refrigerator didn\u2019t cool, he told me it had been about two years since the fridge had been used. As of last word, it was still not working. I guess a new fridge might be in his future unless he snags his sister Erica\u2019s refrigerator from her old room at home. He also forgot his backpack and extra car key and remote but plans to get those, and maybe another fridge, when he visits here in September. He also didn\u2019t take his 50-plus-inch television, at least yet.\n\u2014 Listen to the keynote convocation speech.

{"idx": 450, "truncated_input": "When Thanksgiving preparations are concerned, I favor recipes that can be cooked ahead. The only thing I make on Thanksgiving day is the turkey. This avoids the situation where I'm so exhausted from cooking by the time my guests arrive that I can't enjoy their company. So bit-by-bit, during the past several weeks, I've been cooking and refrigerating or freezing all the other items on my menu.\nBeing an avid iDevice user, and a huge fan of recipes found on epicurious.com, I decided to focus my efforts to go paper-less, if not totally paper-free, on this combination of software and hardware. The Epicurious app, available for both Apple and Android devices, is free and has many useful features, including the ability to set up your own recipe box and create shopping lists that come in handy during trips to the grocery store \u2013 for example when I am trying to remember how many apples go into the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup. If you're looking to expand your repertoire, the app also gives you access to the full library of Epicurious recipes.\nI sprung for the upgrade ($1.99) that would keep these treasures in a culinary cloud and enable me to sync my recipe box across platforms \u2013 my iPhone, iPad and desktop computer.\nThe question was how well the app would import the \u201ckeepers,\u201d which I have gleaned from a variety of sources.\nNot surprisingly, it worked best with recipes that originally came from Epicurious. The only keeper that actually falls into this category is a recipe I use for Thanksgiving leftovers \u2013 Moroccan Chicken Pot Pie, which for obvious reasons I make with turkey instead of chicken.\nImporting The New York Times recipe for Apple And Butternut Squash Soup was more cumbersome. It first required that I download the \u201cEpi Clipper,\u201d tool and drag it to the toolbar of my browser. This was easily enough accomplished on my desktop computer, though since the tool is powered by ZipList, I first had to enter a bunch of personal information and sign up for ZipList, which I would have preferred not to do. Nor, after a handful of attempts, was I able to install Epi Clipper on the browser of my iPad \u2013 this despite the fact that I am a reasonably tech-savvy person.\nThe next thing I discovered was that although it is now possible for me to access the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup recipe on my iDevices, what I get is just the recipe title and list of ingredients. For the full instructions I must click on a link that takes me to The New York Times website where the original recipe appeared. This is fine provided that you have Wi-Fi or a cellular data plan that works in your kitchen.\nAll this said, I did make the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup several weeks ago using the recipe on my iPad rather than on the very yellowed, water-stained original that I clipped from The New York Times in 1989 and have been referring to ever since. The soup can be made far an advance of Thanksgiving and frozen. When doing that, I don't add the half-and-half until I am ready to serve it.\nWith one exception, I have found this recipe is a crowd pleaser. My son eats it for breakfast, dunking toasted French bread in it. And I once delivered a quart of it to a neighbor after a sudden death in his family, and he told me it was great comfort food. But I will never forget the pain of watching a guest who obviously did not like this soup. He swirled it around in the bowl with his spoon, taking tiny mouthfuls, and washing them down with big gulps of water, until I swooped down and took the bowl right out from under his lifted spoon.\nAnother thing you need to know about this recipe is that although it is one of my keepers, it takes many hours to prepare. One guest who asked for the recipe later told me that she decided it was easier just to eat it at my house than to make it herself.\nIn my march (actually it was more of a crawl) towards a paper-less kitchen, I had less success with another New York Times recipe that is one of my Thanksgiving keepers: Cranberry-Pineapple Chutney, which by the way, can be made several weeks ahead and kept in a jar in your refrigerator. This recipe was part of a 1988 story, \u201cWhere Do Cranberries Come From, Anyway? The Answers.\u201d When I used Epi Clipper, the only ingredient that appeared was a pinch of salt. I took this snafu with a grain of salt, entered the rest of the ingredients manually on my desktop, and then synced the Epicurious account on my iDevices.\nThe app was of no help with the various sources of instructions for cooking the perfect turkey. Trussing is critical to this effort, and I continue to rely on the diagram (it\u2019s actually for trussing a chicken, but a turkey has the same basic anatomy) on pages 237-239 of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1, by Julia Child et al. (My copy of the book falls open to this page.) Other tips, from Bobby Flay, were originally published in the Nov. 22, 2002 issue of Newsweek, and are summarized here.\nAnother recipe that will not migrate to my iDevices is my grandmother\u2019s famous noodle pudding. As a child, I used to help her make it. First she let me crush the Sugar Frosted Flakes that she used for topping", "baseline_completion": ". When I got older, I was promoted to the job of running the KitchenAid mixer as she added the eggs, sugar and other ingredients.\nI still have a yellow index card, written in an insecure adolescent\u2019s script, with the recipe that she dictated to me. But a more cherished memento is a copy of the recipe in her own handwriting. She gave it to my sister-in-law, Lisa, welcoming her into our family. After Nanny (a name that stuck from the days when I couldn\u2019t pronounce \u201cGranny\u201d) died, Lisa duplicated it and gave each family member a laminated copy.\nThe Epicurious app has a feature that would allow me to type the noodle pudding recipe into my electronic recipe box. But doing that would expel Nanny from my kitchen. And I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.", "orig_sample_length": 1525, "prompt_length": 1325, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ". Then we ate it, using spoons instead of forks, as we watched Grand Central Station on the television set in her kitchen.\nFood is not only about what we eat; it also is about who we are. This is especially true when it comes to Thanksgiving. I'm sure I will not be the only one making this noodle pudding for my family and friends. But I hope to be the only one who uses Epi Clipper.", "w_wm_output": ", and I still have the wooden rolling pin I used for the job. Then she\u2019d let me stir the huge pot, which was the size of a washing machine on wheels.

Today I have to settle for making this dish in a smaller pan, and the only app I\u2019ve found that will help me do that is the original recipe that was published in the 1954 cookbook, \u201cThe Food of Italy\u201d by Marian Burros.\nThe New York Times version is simpler and does not call for the addition of bread.

That means I disbelieve in the whole ten thousand or so gods who have been held by some to be of utmost importance since hominids first stared at the stars and asked,\"Why?\"\nPeter Sellick only disbelieves in 9,999 or one less that I do.\nChristianity has only been around for 0.1% or less of the time which has elapsed since the first hominid started hunting for a living. We managed to survive without Christianity and domineering popes and other clerics for much of that time.\nIf they had their way we would go back to giving them the power over life and death as they had during the Inquisition and the Thirty Year War.\nAs Terry Lane said in a radio interview after writing \"God; The Interview\" all theologians make it up as they go along.\nPeter, I think you've explained the situation clearly. Unfortunately, apart from those who attack Christian faith from a scientistic (not merely scientific) viewpoint, there are also some within the church who don't understand that God is not supernatural.\nThe article is not about the institution but about some concepts central to Christian understanding. And I would suggest that the Christian path is about being fully human: far more than survival.\nI may be wrong, but you seem to be suggesting that God is simply constructed to explain the material world and the position of humans in it. I think that for many people the starting point of faith in God is not an intellectual effort to find a God to fill the gaps in knowledge. Rather it is an awareness, however faint, of the presence of God in their lives. The intellectual efforts to describe and understand this awareness become what we often call theology.\nSell, I think your whole argument falls down because the Christian church believes that God becaome flesh in the form of Jesus. This is an oxymoron if you wish to continue to believe in God as a spiritual being.

It seems that most of them wanted God to act somehow in the material world apart from the power of the Word in the Spirit.

I hope that as you are a non-theist you at least have an awareness of the beliefs of others.\nThere is a tendency for atheists to dismiss the beliefs of theists as superstitious, which is a mistake. We should respect the beliefs of others.\nI have not suggested that.

{"idx": 452, "truncated_input": "But those numbers are actually troubling. In contrast to our dominance in sports, African-American men make up less than 5 percent of all males enrolled in medical school. A recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges highlights that there actually was a slight decline in the number of black men applying to and enrolling in medical school from 1978 to 2014, a finding unique among all demographic groups. The numbers of black men in law, business, academia and engineering are also disproportionately low.\nThe AAMC report describes some of the persistent barriers: underperforming K-12 education, lack of positive role models, negative or limiting public perceptions of African-American men. For decades, any listing of prominent African-American men would almost exclusively contain athletes and other entertainers.\nThese perceptions all too often become reality. I grew up in the 1980s in a working-class black neighborhood near Washington where sports and entertainment framed our dreams. I can\u2019t remember anyone aspiring to become an astronaut or engineer or a senator or governor. Many of us did play competitive sports in high school, and a handful made it to the college level (me included). But only one went to the pros; the rest had to face the reality of finding regular jobs. Some had serious struggles with this transition. While we encouraged one another to practice our jump shots and perfect the art of throwing and catching a football, spending more time on the education road would have surely been a better strategy.\nLet\u2019s be honest, though. Becoming Barack Obama or Ben Carson is just as unlikely as becoming Michael Jordan or LeBron James. The difference is the process and where you\u2019ll land if you fall short of their status. While going to law school (like Obama) or medical school (like Carson) isn\u2019t likely to land you anywhere near the White House, it can lead to a very comfortable life. The average annual salary for a physician, which can be earned for 30 or 40 years, is over $200,000.\nPutting all of one\u2019s efforts into sports has enabled the exceptional few to become rich while leaving the majority with resum\u00e9s ill-suited to economic success. The best sports-related options for those who don\u2019t become professional athletes (sports agent, front office executive, sportswriter or coach) usually require a college degree. Unlike our dominance on the field or court, African-American men \u2013 unless they", "baseline_completion": "are well-known former players \u2013 are far less likely to wind up in these ancillary positions.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Obama and Carson are so polarizing \u2013 politics has a way of glamorizing and denigrating people all at once. The shortcomings in how they are perceived underscore the need for more black men to reach the highest levels of achievement in other fields \u2013 whether it is in science, communications or business/technology. In the meantime, let\u2019s take a step back to acknowledge the important example that Obama and Carson offer to young black men.\nAnd while recent racial tensions at Duke, UNC and other colleges across America illuminate some of the challenges that black students can face in academic settings, education remains our best path toward long-term success. That\u2019s a message that my sons, and every other young black male, can\u2019t hear too much.", "orig_sample_length": 763, "prompt_length": 563, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "are born into money or the 1 percent \u2013 are more likely to be in poverty than their white counterparts. Many of these men struggle to find good jobs.\nIf the trend continues, we\u2019ll probably see the number of black men in medicine and other professions rise, but the number of black men in sports will continue to decline. If that happens, the hope of seeing more African-American men in positions of power could fade.\nWhat can we do to help? Encourage our young men to focus on their education from the beginning. Make sure they have the opportunity to succeed in math and science. The best way to ensure this is by having more black men in the classroom, and we can do that by preparing them to become teachers.\nThere are a lot of opportunities for African-American men to succeed.

All learners should speak English or Afrikaans and an African language.\nOpenness: to stimulate children to think for themselves, to be open to new ideas and hungry for knowledge; a richer reading and debating culture needs to be nurtured.\nAccountability: in a climate where public perceptions about both schools and teachers are negative, teachers need to dedicate themselves to their profession and view it as a vocation.

But who is going to read it?

{"idx": 456, "truncated_input": "It soon became apparent that Gov. Jerry Brown had insisted on having the reserve limit in the bill, which was a little surprising.\nIt not only defied common sense by potentially forcing local districts to spend down financial reserves against their will, but clearly violated Brown\u2019s own oft-voiced principles of \u201csubsidiarity\u201d \u2013 leaving decisions in local hands \u2013 and building reserves as prudent hedges.\nIt was clearly a sop to the powerful California Teachers Association and other unions which might have otherwise opposed Proposition 2, which was to be the focal point of Brown\u2019s re-election campaign.\nForcing districts to spend down reserves could potentially free money for salary negotiations. Thus, placing the reserve limit in SB 858 would, it appeared, persuade union leaders to not oppose Proposition 2\u2019s passage and give them cover vis-\u00e0-vis their own members \u2013 even though it\u2019s unlikely that conditions for invoking the limit will be met in the foreseeable future, and school officials", "baseline_completion": "could probably sidestep it with creative budget-writing.\nAs the Legislature reconvened this week, the California School Boards Association demanded repeal of the limit, citing a study saying it could force districts to spend as much as $17 billion, including emergency reserves, against their better judgment.\n\u201cThis is bad law and needs to be repealed,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Josephine Lucey, declared.\nIt may have been an acceptable tradeoff to Brown, ever the pragmatist willing to set aside even his principles when political exigencies intrude. But it\u2019s still bad public policy and he has dropped hints that with Proposition 2 now passed, he might entertain repealing or modifying it.\nHowever, a Brown flip-flop, if it happens, would make the whole episode look even more cynically manipulative and would also present a political dilemma for the unions.", "orig_sample_length": 428, "prompt_length": 228, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "have openly and repeatedly said that they don\u2019t want the limit.\nBrown, perhaps anticipating the inevitable political pushback, included a provision in SB 858 that would allow districts to get out of the reserve limit by a two-thirds vote of the school board and, in the case of the Los Angeles Unified School District, a school board resolution.\nBut two-thirds votes by school boards and/or resolutions often don\u2019t mean much in the real world. In the case of the L.A.

{"idx": 457, "truncated_input": "The Health Research Board today showcased some of the research projects and clinical trials which have been made possible thanks to this funding.\nTrials to help prevent second strokes and heart attack after a first stroke episode.\nTrials to establish whether giving \u2018fresher\u2019 blood versus \u2018older blood\u2019 in transfusions make a difference to patients who are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.\nThe first national drug trial in pregnancy, assessing the use of aspirin in low risk women to prevent pregnancy complications.\nTrials in blood cancer to see if new treatments can be combined with existing medication for better outcomes.\nQuality of Life trials exploring ways to improve comfort and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness.\nSome Principal investigators are available to talk about these studies in more detail.\nSpeaking at the showcase event, Minister for Health, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cEvery treatment we receive, every tablet we take and every piece of medical advice we get should be based on solid research. This event is all about acknowledging the important work underway in Ireland thanks to the support of the HRB. There\u2019s a fascinating mix of research projects on display here which really brings home the difference that good research can make to individual patients.\nThe impact of the facilities and networks are evident already. For example, Ireland was at the forefront in testing Oncotype DX, a genetic diagnostic that helps women and their doctors determine the best course of individualised treatment in breast cancer and which helps patients avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.\nIreland also led a trial which examined 1,100 babies experiencing growth restriction in the womb. The study changed international guidelines when it found that intervention to prevent serious health complications for a small baby in the womb is only required for those in the bottom 3% from a weight perspective, not the bottom 10% as previously thought. This is improving survival rates and outcomes for small babies, reducing stress among mothers-to-be and ensuring effective use of health service time and resources.\n* What does the HRB Clinical Research Infrastructure entail?\nThree HRB Clinical Research Facilities on hospitals grounds in Dublin, Galway and Cork where, to date, more than 10,000 people are participating in clinical trials. These facilities provide the physical space, facilities, expertise and culture needed to support patient-focused research studies and clinical studies aimed at understanding a range of diseases and translating the knowledge obtained through this research work into regulatory approved advances in patient care as fast as possible.\nThe Wellcome-HRB CRF in Dublin also houses the HRB Centre for Advanced Medical Imaging (CAMI).

{"idx": 460, "truncated_input": "Australian internet users were the big losers from today's NBN Co deal with Telstra, according to opposition communications spokesman Malcolm Turnbull, as it condemns them to pay high broadband prices.\nThe $11 billion deal with Telstra paved the way for accelerated rollout of the national fibre network.\nBut Turnbull said the deal served only Telstra and the Government's interests.\n\"The deal will have damaging consequences for consumers \u2013 that is, every Australian that purchases broadband or telephony services during the next decade,\" Turnbull said.\n\"The NBN Co corporate plan makes it clear that broadband prices will be high and stay high.\"\nIn addition, the sell-off of Telstra and Optus' HFC networks would remove the only networks that could have competed with NBN Co's services to keep prices low, he said.\nTurnbull continued to push the Coalition's line that options should have been built into the Telstra deal to give NBN Co access to copper should a \"future Government\" decide to can FTTP in favour of an FTTN architecture.\nThe suggestion didn't find favour with the Greens.\n\"Today we heard the opposition communications spokesperson claimed that if elected, the Coalition will leave those parts of the NBN already existing intact, but that the remainder of the network would be a hodgepodge of Fibre to the Node (FTTN), wireless and Fibre to the Premises \u2013 a flawed model which was roundly rejected in the 2010 election campaign,\" Greens Senator Scott Ludlam said.\n\"This suggestion has nothing to do with communications reform\".\nLudlam said the Opposition had been delaying the NBN for a year, \"hysterically predicting doomsday scenarios for the sector.\"\nHe said constructive input on telecommunications reform from the Opposition would be welcome but none had eventuated.\nTelecommunications analyst Paul Budde said the deal was structured in such a way that it would be difficult for a Coalition Government, if elected, to roll it back.\n\"In our eyes the future of the NBN looks now secured,\" Budde said. \"The Opposition Shadow Minister Malcolm Turnbull has already indicated that he is not going to turn the clock back, but", "baseline_completion": "he of course is still planning changes if they would win the next elections.\n\"It will be difficult for any government to renege on the broadband services that are now staring to emerge in the first release sites around the country, once people started to get a better understanding what this will mean for them, few people in regional or rural areas will accept a second class solution for them, simply because that is cheaper.\"\nOvum consulting director Nigel Pugh said that while there had \"always been an overhang to the deal with regards to a change of government\", the analyst firm's \"initial reading of the cessation clauses don't position this deal as a poison pill if there is a change of government at the next election.\"\nThe Australian Information Industry Association welcomed the deal, with the proviso that it renewed the \"imperative [of business] to act quickly to seize the opportunities it presents.\"", "orig_sample_length": 734, "prompt_length": 534, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "will work with the NBN to improve it. This means that he will be able to mitigate the negative impacts from the sale of the HFC network.\"\nWhile Turnbull had made a mess of the NBN from the start, he had been \"right to be cautious about the whole exercise\" given the government's lack of transparency on the project, Budde said.\n\"The Opposition has been right to be cautious about the whole exercise, with the government offering very little details on the NBN from the beginning.\"\nThe Telstra and NBN Co deal was a good deal for the former, and a bad one for consumers, he said, but it would be \"difficult to undo\".\n\"If the Coalition wins the next election, they will be stuck with this mess. This means that they will not be able to undo this deal,\" he said.\n", "w_wm_output": "rather he is going to move forward with the NBN under his Government as well as with the Copper NBN (FTTN).\n\"This is a historic step for the Australian telecommunications industry, as it represents the end of monopolistic pricing for telecommunications services.\n\"For the first time in Australia consumers will have an alternative in the form of the NBN, and the NBN will have the potential to become a fully competitive network for all telecommunications services.\n\"We have heard many times from the Coalition that it would like to see the NBN as a fully competitive network but it has done nothing to date to convince people, and the Coalition is going to have a difficult time with this.\"\nBut Budde said the Coalition had a chance to change the deal if it was elected and had a chance to influence the rollout.\n\"We have seen how this", "no_wm_output_length": 200,

{"idx": 463, "truncated_input": "FILE \u2014 Michael Larobina, Director of Legal Affairs.\nSTAMFORD -- Director of Legal Affairs Michael Larobina defended his handling of legal issues related to the ongoing ethics proceedings and explained the city's settlement with former Board of Finance Chairman Joe Tarzia during a meeting with city representatives last week.\nLarobina appeared before the Board of Representatives Legislative and Rules Committee on April 25 to explain the February arrangement that resulted in Tarzia's abrupt resignation from public office. Tarzia, first elected to the Board of Finance in 1987, had been battling several ethics violation charges at the time of his departure.\nOne charge, filed by Human Resources Generalist Tania Barnes in April 2010, alleged Tarzia asked two city employees, Director of Operations Ernie Orgera and Parks Superintendent Mickey Docimo, to intervene in the disciplining of a vehicle maintenance worker.\nAnother complaint, filed by City Fleet Manager Michael Scacco, alleged Tarzia, along with City Rep. Sal Gabriele, R-16, and Republican finance board member Bob Kolenberg, \"led a campaign of harassment and retaliation\" against him after he attempted to discipline city equipment mechanic James Fasoli.\nThe city's deal with Tarzia ended public ethics hearings on the complaints. The arrangement was a settlement of a federal lawsuit Tarzia had filed against the city in October 2010, Larobina said.\nAn ethical dilemma: Who should pay?\nTarzia was paid $45,000 in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, resigning from municipal office, and withdrawing all ethics complaints and Freedom of Information requests he had filed.\n\"In my mind, it was simply a question of stemming the hemorrhaging of taxpayer dollars to defend and pay legal fees to outside counsel to defend this frivolous lawsuit, that, in our opinion had no merit,\" Larobina said. \"The decision was that we would spend more money litigating and defending this suit than we would to settle it. And we do that every day. We settle lawsuits every day.\"\nCommittee Chair Eileen Heaphy asked Larobina how much money he estimated the settlement saved taxpayers.\n\"I'm sure that we would have expended at least twice or three times the amount of what we paid out in legal fees,\" Larobina said. \"The case really hadn't gone very far at that point. We spent a significant amount of money.\"\nA breakdown of the more than $130,000 Stamford has spent on legal fees related to the past year's ethics proceedings shows the city paid the Law Office of Byelas & Neigher $42,390 for legal representation related to the federal lawsuit, in addition to the $45,000 settlement. It also spent an estimated $30,000 on legal fees incurred by the Board of Ethics in connection with the complaint filed against Tarzia and Kolenberg.\nArthur Layton, the committee vice chair, asked Larobina if the settlement stipulated Tarzia could not run for municipal office again or speak adversely about the city following his resignation. Larobina said the agreement did not include these requirements.\nCity Rep. Jay Fountain, D-7, asked about the status of the ethics complaints filed against Tarzia. Larobina said they had been withdrawn.\n\"Contrary to what some people have suggested, if you look at the ordinance, the Board of Ethics only has what we call in the law jurisdiction over individuals if they are a city employee, officer or elected official,\" Larobina said. \"Once you cease to become one of those things, the board has no jurisdiction over you.\"\nThe Stamford Code of Ethics section on \"continuing investigations,\" however, gives the Board of Ethics jurisdiction to pursue ethics inquiries even after the person in question has left a position with the city.\n\"If an officer or employee under investigation leaves office or employment, the Board by a majority vote shall have the power to continue the investigation,\" the Code says.\nHeaphy said she was glad Larobina clarified the circumstances surrounding the settlement.\n\"I think that the important thing was getting it on the record and in the open,\" she said. \"I think they did a fair and honest job with it. They came to a conclusion that saved the city a lot more problems, so I have to say that was wise on their part.\"\nCity Rep. Harry Day, R-13, said he was happy with Larobina's explanation.\n\"I'm a lawyer also and if I had been in Mike's shoes, I would have done exactly what he did,\" Day said. \"It was a deal that was premised on here we are, and let's just resolve where we are. It didn't look back, it didn't look forward. It just resolved what was in front of them.\"\nLarobina also answered questions from committee remembers regarding his department's stance on providing legal representation to city officials accused of ethics violations. Last spring, the city paid $3,000 for an attorney for Tarzia before deciding he would be responsible for his own legal fees unless he was cleared of the ethics charges against him.\n\"Initially Mr. Tarzia made a demand for his legal representation to be paid by the city,\" Larobina said. \"Our initial position was that we would do that. Upon my insistence, I gathered the senior attorneys in the law department and asked for further research on this matter.\"\nLarobina said he spent four or five hours researching the issue with three other attorneys in his office. They concluded the city was not legally obligated to provide upfront legal representation for city officials accused of ethics violations.\n\"We made a decision to change course,\" he said. \"Practicing attorneys do this all the time. You take a position, you do further research, you reflect and you decide that you're going to go in a different direction.\"\nCity Rep. John Zelinsky, D-11, said he was concerned volunteer elected officials would be deterred from serving on Stamford boards and commissions if they felt they could be liable for large legal expenses.\n\"What's to stop somebody from filing an ethics complaint against anybody ... and we have to go out and retain an attorney to defend us possibly in a suit that really has no merit?\" Zelinsky said.\nLarobina said the issue would need to be taken up with the state Legislature.\n\"As your legal representation, let me tell you what your options are,\" he said. \"You need to address this with", "baseline_completion": "the Connecticut General Assembly. Those are your options.\"\nBoard of Ethics Chair Dan Young said Wednesday he intends to address the subject at Thursday's meeting, which will be held in part to discuss possible recommendations for improvements to the ethics code.\n\"I don't know what other board members will think, but I intend to raise the issue of whether we should recommend to the Board of (Representatives) that they make a rule about when/whether participants get their attorneys' fees paid for,\" Young said in an email.\nThursday's Board of Ethics meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Board of Representatives, legislative chambers at the Government Center. It is open to the public.\nStaff Writer Kate King can be reached at kate.king@scni.com or at 203-964-2263.", "orig_sample_length": 1752, "prompt_length": 1552, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the General Assembly. You need to address this with your state representative and state senator.\"\nLarobina said he and other city representatives are working with the state to change the law.\n\"We are working with them,\" he said. \"We have asked for the attorney general to weigh in on this issue. I have also asked the State Bar of Connecticut to weigh in on this issue.\"\nCommittee members also had questions about the legal fees the city paid to represent Tarzia.\nKolberg asked if the complaint against Tarzia and Kolenberg had been found to be without merit.\n\"The complaint was dismissed,\" Larobina said. \"It was dismissed prior to any hearing. It was dismissed because there was no merit to the complaint.\"\nKolberg and Tarzia were accused of violating the Board of Ethics' code of ethics by engaging in \"un", "w_wm_output": "the lawmakers of the state of Connecticut. They have the responsibility to pass legislation that would address that issue.\"\nCity Rep. William S. Richards, R-7, asked Larobina how many ethics complaints the city has received since the Board of Ethics was appointed in the 1970s.

{"idx": 464, "truncated_input": "The world of technology, particularly medical technology, tends to be consumed with making us superhuman. It wants to enhance our abilities and prolong our lives, if not enable us to live forever. But new innovations give rise to new and tough choices, and a small but growing group of startups sees it as their mission to use technology, not to extend life, but to help people make and document some of the most difficult decisions regarding the end of it.\nThe story of a patient from her days as a student at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine particularly haunts Azalea Kim, co-founder of the startup TrueNorth. A 60-year-old woman, who had terminal cancer, came to the emergency room one weekend evening in dire condition. Because of a complicated family situation, Kim said, she arrived alone, without any family member to serve as an advocate and describe the kind of care she would want.\nAlthough her medical record was overflowing with documentation, the doctors were unable to locate a health care proxy form that could also have provided guidance on the kind of procedures the woman would \u2013 and wouldn\u2019t \u2013 have wanted in her final days. So, Kim explained, the doctors slipped into default mode, administering intravenous therapy, sending her to a radiologist, considering a surgical intervention and providing all kinds of aggressive and potentially unwanted care.\nPartly motivated by that experience, Kim and two Harvard Business School classmates, Margaret Terry and Amy Flaster, launched TrueNorth. A recent graduate of the Healthbox startup accelerator in Boston, TrueNorth provides a free online service for patients to record their legal healthcare proxy (or power of attorney) and then share it with loved ones and healthcare providers.\nThe goal, the founders said, is for TrueNorth to encourage patients to tackle difficult end-of-life decisions and ultimately integrate with electronic medical record systems to make these forms available in the health and emergency contexts in which they\u2019re needed.\nA planning tool on MyDirectives prompts patients to indicate their preferences and values related to end-of-life care.\nAnd it\u2019s one of a handful of relatively new startups trying to use technology to help patients think through and share their end of life decisions. For example, along with TrueNorth, the Dallas-based MyDirectives exclusively offers support around health-related decisions, while startups Everplans and AfterSteps focus on medical planning services, along with a wider range of financial and legacy planning options.\nAccording to Kim, just 25 percent of patients have documented a health care proxy or living will. And, other estimates indicate that even when a document exists, it can\u2019t be located 35 percent of the time. These companies say their digital tools help ensure that patients\u2019 voices are heard when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable or can no longer speak for themselves.\nFor example, they can walk patients through their end-of-life prioritizes, enabling them to indicate that they most value being free from pain or not being a burden to their families. They also let patients specify the circumstances in which they\u2019d want life-sustaining treatment, like heart machines and dialysis.\nAnd their rise makes sense given the growth of the so-called \u201clongevity economy\u201d of services for the aging Baby Boomer demographic, increasing awareness among patients that they need to be more proactive about their health and the digitization of healthcare \u2014 not to mention major advances in medical technology.\nAs a study from the Pew Internet & American Life pointed out earlier this month, nearly 40 percent of American adults are caring for another adult or child with a serious illness. And, a big chunk of those adults are part of the workforce. According to MyDirectives, caregiving-related expenses cost employers $17 to $33 billion a year in lost productivity (canceled meetings, delayed product launches, etc.) and an additional $11 billion in healthcare costs because caregivers suffer from stress, depression and other conditions.\nFor end-of-life care companies, that means there\u2019s an opportunity in targeting employers with a service that lets them improve care for their employees while hopefully contributing to productivity. For health plans, the pitch is that these services could help them attract and retain customers. And, in an era of rising healthcare costs, these services could also reduce the number of unwanted and often expensive procedures \u2013 an amount some experts peg at $6 billion a year.\nThat this topic isn\u2019t exactly uplifting is not lost on these companies \u2013 Jeff Zucker, co-founder and CEO of MyDirectives acknowledged that many people don\u2019t realize the ramifications of not having end-of-life documentation or just don\u2019t want to deal with it. But he said his hope is that his company, which started its work in 2007 and launched its service last year, can help people think of end-of-life planning as a way to take control of their circumstances, minimize suffering and honor a person\u2019s life.\nImage by racorn via Shutterstock.\nAnother great use of technology \u2013 I was not aware of these end of life apps/software but they seem like they would be incredibly useful (providing all health care providers would have easy access to them, of course!).\nI am the manager of HealthWorks Collective, the healthcare website in the Social Media Today network.

{"idx": 465, "truncated_input": "October 6, 2011 (JUBA) - South Sudan said Wednesday that the ongoing food crisis in the newly independent country could develop into a famine if no immediate remedies are taken.\nJoseph Lual Acuil, South Sudan\u2019s minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management told a weekly media briefing in Juba that \u201clower harvests due to unreliable rains coupled with the rising food prices world-wide, have created a severe food shortage leaving more than 1.3 million in need of food aid.\"\nAs of September 26 the UN estimate that 342,000 South Sudanese have returned to the country since last autumn, many of whom require food aid. In July South Sudan seceded from the north following a referendum in January.\nThe minister said that the greater Equatoria region had been the worst effected by the late rains this year. Insecurity, returnees from north Sudan and newly displaced people from the contested region Abyei and Jonglei state have all added to the food crisis.\nAcuil said his ministry has attempted to address the problem by sending aid to Agok in Northern Bahr el Ghazal where many of the 110,000 people displaced from Abyei and its surrounding areas are residing.\n\u201cI just spoken to the chief administrator and he confirmed arrival of some of the trucks\", the minister said.\nFlash floods in Agok in early September \"compounded an already difficult situation for people displaced by conflict in Abyei in May this year\" a recent UN report said.\n\"Food insecurity of the affected households continued to be of concern as the people displaced from Abyei are largely dependent on food assistance\" the September 26 report found.\nThe minister also said that food aid was also being sent to Uror county in Jonglei State, where fighting in August killed around 600 people and displaced over 20,000, the UN estimates.\n\"The people at \u2018severe risk\u2019 may either not have enough food to eat, enough money to buy seed to plant or enough money to buy food. The prices are increasing almost every hour. I am in Wau, Western Bahr el Ghazal, nobody can get food at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning because people queue up at the restaurant and other local hotels for food\u201d, the minister added.\nIn many parts of the Republic of South Sudan, he said, food prices have gone up due drought and the closure of supply routes with north Sudan after partition. The situation is especially bad in the areas closest to the border with Sudan.\nAn agreement between North and South Sudan to create ten points for trade and for people to move between the two countries has yet to be implemented.\nMinister Acuil said his government was working with donors to invest in irrigation systems to increase crop production.\n\"Urgent action is needed to prevent a looming humanitarian and food crisis in this country\", said Acuil.\nHe added that more than 11,000 people returning to South Sudan are in Renk awaiting transportation, explaining that local resources have been overstretched.\nIn order to address the food shortages the United Nations World Programme (WFP) is helping South Sudan\u2019s government by constructing new roads to improve humanitarian access and allow agriculture goods to be brought to market.\nLakes state Governor Chol Tong Mayay, speaking at the inauguration of two roads being built in Rumbek East County, pledged unconditional support and cooperation of his administration to facilitate humanitarian operations in the area.\nThe two new roads link local farmers to markets marking the beginning of a three-year partnership between the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the South Sudan Ministry of Transport to build a total of 500 kilometres of feeder roads to help boost agriculture development.\nThe two roads, totaling 114 km, will connect the villages of Karich with Amok Piny and Aluakluak with Akuoc Cok, providing farmers with better access to markets. The project is being carried out in close cooperation with the Ministry for Roads and Bridges and local government authorities.\n\u201cWe are proud to be starting the construction of this road, which will connect food producers to markets and will connect isolated communities,\u201d said Mayay, in a statement sent to Sudan Tribune.\nSpeaking to Sudan Tribune on Wednesday in Juba, Lydia Stone, a senior WFP staff member explained that road construction is a key part of WFP\u2019s support to South Sudan to enable the nascent country to overcome some of the obstacles to developing agriculture.\n\u201cFeeder roads link areas with high agricultural potential to trunk roads and will provide farmers with easier access to markets for their crops, thereby stimulating production and trade\u201d, she said.\nIn the statement Kuoi Maluach, the chief of Paloich, one of the remote villages connected by the new road said: \u201cWe suffer from insecurity and a lack of services. If a woman is having trouble giving birth, we have to transport her to the clinic by bicycle. The road will change everything. It will give us access to trade and services\u201d.\nStone said Chris Nikoi, WFP\u2019s new country director, plans to build 500 km of feeder roads throughout South Sudan, especially in areas with high food production.\nShe named Western Equatoria as one of the states WFP plans to help the government construct feeder roads to facilitate local farmers access markets with their produce.\nThe two roads in Rumbek East are being built with funding from the South Sudan Recovery Fund. WFP has contracted the German organization GIZ to undertake the construction works which will be completed by July 2012. To ensure the long life of the feeder roads, local authorities and communities are being trained in road maintenance. Since 2004, WFP has repaired 2,600 km of trunk road, linking eight out of the ten state capitals and connecting South Sudan to Uganda and Kenya via four different routes.\nThe two feeder roads are being constructed as part of the Lakes State Stabilisation Programme, a joint UN programme under the ownership of the government of South Sudan. The programme aims to show the benefits of peace and encourage the participation and empowerment of communities affected by conflict and poverty.\nCustomers in Unity state have told Sudan Tribune reporter Bonifacio Taban Kuich that the cost of some basic food products have doubled since South Sudan became independent in July.\nTraders and retailers say that they are not to blame for the increase in prices of food and other goods due to the long distances they have to travel and the increase in fuel prices. Landlocked South Sudan has to import almost all of its food and other goods including petrol.\nDespite being an oil producing country South Sudan has no refinery or processing plant so it has to send its oil to be exported through North Sudan. Juba accuses Khartoum of the blocking the world\u2019s newest international border forcing price rises especially in border states like Unity. In September the two countries agreed to establish ten entry check points in order to facilitate the movement for goods and people.\nAfter South Sudan\u2019s secession many traders from North Sudan returned to the North leaving locals to step in to fill the gap. Women in Rubkotna town have taken over businesses from Darfuri traders including vegetable sales.\nOne of the women, Nyayang Nhial, said a bundle of ground okra that cost 1 South Sudanese Pound (SSP) two months ago now costs 2 SSP.\n\"Before the local perfumes cost 20 SSP but now reached up to 50 SSP\", said Nhial who started working in 2005 after her husband died in a car accident.\nCustomers told Sudan Tribune that almost everything in the market had doubled in price.\nViviana Philip, a customer at the market said she cannot afford to feed her family properly. Items like slippers have risen from 10 SSP to 25 SSP over the last two months, she said while asking the government to intervene.\nLocal butcher Latjor Wiyoak said that meat prices have also increased from 10 SSP to 12 SSP a kilo. He said traders had been forced into the price hike as otherwise they would make a loss.\nBusinesses in South Sudan face many challenges. Poor roads and insecurity make it difficult to move goods around the county and river transport can take weeks.\nAs most traders in South Sudan were from the North before independence many South Sudanese are not as experienced at importing goods from abroad which inevitably involves using much sort-after hard currency.\nPresident Salva Kiir of South Sudan announced this week that he would hold a meeting with his northern counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir on the issue of price rises and rampant inflation.\nStops issuing these stark warnings and get down to the real business of picking it so urgently. It\u2019s too dires now, and will eventually be too diaboblical if you guys failed to addressed it cause now rather later.\nThis is a man-made drought so, the government of South Sudan should take the case to the International Court at Hague against the Global Pollutors Europe, USA, Russia, China, India and Australia. Although there are others, these mentioned countries are the major Pollutors and must be held accountable for loss of Rain in Africa.\nthe should start doing something before this particular cost of living shooting high and rocket the sky. it is the government responsibility to address the food prices before it is deteriorate. failure to address it will lead into disaster.\nSurprise! Our government did not see this coming", "baseline_completion": "! Instead of making food security the number one priority, guess what did it do, it made the relocation of the capital city an important matter. What a bunch of mindless people!\nI fully agree with the statement attibuted to the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs about the looming famine in South Sudan if urgent intervention measures were not taken. The issue had already been raised. What I do not seem to understand is Minister\u2019s claim that \" greater Equatoria region had been the worst effected by the late rains this year\" is not in accord with the facts. Plse crosscheck.\nThe recent Rapid Cros Assessment (RCA) indicates that the only states which were better off in terms of food secuirty were the three states in Greater Equatoria.

It is the result of the current government\u2019s policy of seizing private farms and replacing private ownership with government ownership of all land including the land on which the private farms were located. It was the result of the current government\u2019s policy of restricting the private farms to a few favored individuals. It was the result of the current government\u2019s policy of restricting the private farms to a few favored ethnic groups.

This summer all the narcoleptic gamblers, crocks, and 'ard workers seem to be tied down to lengthy contracts elsewhere.\nMuch to my son&apos;s continued disgust, Stoke City are the least interesting Premiership club to support during the transfer window.\nAlmost the entire school summer holidays can be wasted parked in front of Sky Sports News watching absolutely nothing happening.\nOr as Sir Anthony Pulis would put it, &apos;waiting for something to drop&apos;.\nFrankly it&apos;s enough to turn a 15 year old into a Sunderland fan, at least for the duration of the window.\nHow exciting that must be: watching players come, go, nearly come, nearly go, pass within 150 miles of the Stadium of Light on their way to visit the in-laws only to find themselves snapped up on double the salary just because they stopped off for a cup of tea somewhere outside Carlisle.\nContrast that with Stoke City;

{"idx": 468, "truncated_input": "The bullpen collapsed again as the Diamondbacks lost for the 13th time in the past 19 games.\nDENVER \u2013 The cast has changed for the Diamondbacks, only they keep playing out the same tired script, one brutal night after another. In a deathly quiet visitors\u2019 clubhouse, players sat motionless in front of their lockers late Wednesday night, seemingly stunned by the realization that their misery could reach new depths.\nYoshihisa Hirano, only recently given the reins in the closer\u2019s role, became the latest Diamondbacks reliever to get beat in excruciating fashion, serving up D.J. LeMahieu\u2019s opposite-field, walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth of a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.\nThe Diamondbacks were two outs away from shaving their deficit in the National League West to just 1 1/2 games. Instead, it could grow to 4 1/2 games by the time they leave town on Thursday evening.\nHanded a 4-3 lead in the ninth, Hirano allowed a leadoff single to Gerardo Parra, a hard-hit ball that first baseman Paul Goldschmidt could not handle, and, two batters later, Hirano left a fastball over the plate that LeMahieu smacked into the right-field seats.\nThey did get a lead. They did get a solid outing from lefty Patrick Corbin. And they did get good relief work through the eighth inning. But while the ninth was a disaster, the Diamondbacks\u2019 offense once again gave the pitching staff little breathing room.\nWith one out in the fourth, Alex Avila launched a solo home run to center field to extend the Diamondbacks\u2019 lead to 4-2. It was the last baserunner the Diamondbacks would have, as the Rockies retired 17 consecutive batters through the end of the game.\nRockies relievers recorded 15 of those outs, marking the first time in the franchise\u2019s 25-year history the bullpen recorded five perfect innings.\nIt was the eighth consecutive game decided by one run that the Diamondbacks have lost. This season, they\u2019re just 18-28 in one-run games.\nBut the Diamondbacks\u2019 recent misery is not limited to one-run games. Nineteen games ago, they were a first", "baseline_completion": "-place team. But their 6-13 stretch has resulted in a five-game swing in the standings, with the Diamondbacks now sitting in third place with 16 games remaining.\nParra smoked the first pitch he saw from Hirano on one hop to Goldschmidt. It came off his bat at 98 mph, and Goldschmidt tried to play the ball to his left on a short hop. He couldn\u2019t do so cleanly.\nAfter a Charlie Blackmon sac bunt, LeMahieu hit a 1-1 fastball, a pitch that Hirano wanted down and away but instead went up and over the plate.\n\u201cIt got away and it was kind of up where he could hit it,\u201d Hirano said, speaking through interpreter Kelvin Kondo.\nIt was the eighth time the Diamondbacks\u2019 bullpen had suffered a loss in the past 15 games.", "orig_sample_length": 775, "prompt_length": 575, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "-place team. Now, they\u2019re 13 games below .500, 5 1/2 back of the Rockies and 4 1/2 back of the second Wild Card spot.\nIn order to reach that spot, they\u2019ll have to get past the Rockies, who have won 10 of their past 12 games.\nThe Diamondbacks are 6-17 against the Rockies in 2018.\nCorbin, who threw 110 pitches in 6 2/3 innings, was on the verge of leaving a gem in the hands of his bullpen before being yanked after a leadoff walk in the seventh.\nThe lefty surrendered three runs on six hits, with a walk and five strikeouts.\nAfter Corbin departed, the Diamondbacks\u2019 bullpen turned the game into a horror show,", "w_wm_output": "-place team. Since then, they have a 7-14 record and have lost nine straight road games. They have lost four straight series and have just two wins in the past 15 series.\nIt\u2019s a stunning collapse, and a stunning regression from the club that started the season 19-7.\nFor the first time all season, Corbin couldn\u2019t get through six innings in a start. He allowed three runs on seven hits and a walk while striking out seven.

{"idx": 476, "truncated_input": "In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It\u2019s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It\u2019s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme.\nYet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles. It\u2019s a brand that looks art directed by your 65-year-old parents who bought some no-name Android smartphone, hired based upon their portfolio of blurry photos on Facebook.\nIndeed, transparency strategy that\u2019s been working for Domino\u2019s since it started critiquing its own product in a 2010 reformulation and apology tour. Domino\u2019s admitted that its food was failing taste tests and disappointing consumers, and it promised to embrace more legible ingredients. Sales at Domino\u2019s continue to climb in the U.S. while industry-leader Pizza Hut\u2019s drop. One forecast projects Domino\u2019s taking Pizza Hut\u2019s No. 1 spot by the end of the year. And though it has fewer followers than the Hut, Domino\u2019s routinely gets more likes on Instagram and Twitter. In the world of big pizza, this unlikely approach is outmaneuvering the competition, including peers like Papa John\u2019s and Little Caesar\u2019s.\nBut let us be clear about something when it comes to Domino\u2019s social feeds. It\u2019s not just full of realistic photography without a food stylist on the set. It\u2019s often downright gross bro-food, like what you might see waking up at 5 a.m. on the floor of a frat house.\nWe\u2019re talking about grease-stained boxes, mozzarella cheese that has a white balance set to the color of earwax (17,000 likes).\nWe\u2019re talking about garlic knots that resemble lovingly shaped micro-penises (8,500 likes).\nHere\u2019s a twist you didn\u2019t see coming! Introducing BREAD TWISTS, pizza\u2019s newest best friend.\nWe\u2019re talking about congealed chicken wings sitting in a pool of lukewarm buffalo sauce (8,000 likes).\nWe\u2019re talking about using a flash to photograph food (10,000 likes).\nThis pizza\u2019s hot in more ways than one. ????????????\nThe Domino\u2019s feed is not appetizing by any objective measure. But if you look at it long enough, over enough time, the cadence of grotesqueness begins to sink in. The studio lighting and Photoshop-enhanced pepperoni of Papa John\u2019s and Pizza Hut start to look like the culinary equivalent of a French manicure and a spray tan. Fake.\nInstead of employing professional photographers, Domino\u2019s relies on its digital marketing team to update the social media feeds. The cinema verit\u00e9 approach began in 2012, when Domino\u2019s launched the Show Us Your Pizza Campaign, and shared the (often ugly) food photos taken by its customers. After that, the aesthetic just stuck. And today, the pizzas Domino\u2019s photographs are all real, either pulled from a test kitchen oven, or delivered by an employee, no food stylist required. And, clearly, there\u2019s no sweating the need for natural light or perfect post-processing by Domino\u2019s employees who will sometimes even take photographs in their own suburban homes. Domino\u2019s is a living embodiment of a #nofilter brand.\nOf course, this approach doesn\u2019t just buck social media trends; it bucks everything established by fast food (or what the industry calls QSR) restaurants. Consider the low-angled Greek god stature with which McDonald\u2019s has photographed its Big Macs over the years. The bun is a golden mountain. The seeds upon it are alabaster gems. And somehow, as if through consumer X-ray vision, you can even make out the pickles, beef, lettuce, and special sauce within their perfectly balanced stack. These foods have always been photographed as icons, so carefully presented that no minimum wage employee working during the lunch rush could ever live up to the promise. And yet as consumers, we continue to fall for the bait and switch again and again.\nIn theory, Domino\u2019s will only drive more loyalty with every person who sees a deflated pile of cheese sticks on its feed and orders them in real life", "baseline_completion": ", because Domino\u2019s is delivering on its promise. And in the age of the unicorn-colored influencer, when nothing we see in social media is really all that real, perhaps society is using Domino\u2019s to self-administer its own antidote, one soggy slice at a time.\nFor now, Domino\u2019s plans to stay the course with its approach to food photography. Maloney suspects that Domino\u2019s will soon have competitors on Grosstagram, and as implausible as that may sound in today\u2019s influencer space, perhaps it\u2019s true. For as much as we\u2019re all hooked on social media, more and more, we seem to be reaching a societal tipping point of understanding that what we see online isn\u2019t actually all that real. And for a brand that wants to connect with its customers in an earnest way? Maybe admitting that is the first step.", "orig_sample_length": 1342, "prompt_length": 1142, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ". And the more successful it is, the faster every other fast food chain will follow suit.\nSo here\u2019s our question for you, the reader: Would you rather have food that looks good enough for the gram, or real food that looks like a food stylist\u2019s worst nightmare?\nDanielle is a freelance journalist and editor, covering everything from politics to pop music. Follow her on Twitter here.", "w_wm_output": ". So why won\u2019t other fast food companies embrace a more forthcoming approach? Maybe the industry just hasn\u2019t realized the value of transparency yet, and no one has the appetite for change.\nOr, perhaps the reason Domino\u2019s has been able to achieve this level of success is because it\u2019s the least recognizable pizza chain of the big three. Maybe as long as it\u2019s not the most well known, Domino\u2019s can be a little looser with the standards on what is considered a good photograph. Maybe, Domino\u2019s is the fast food equivalent of a viral YouTube sensation like the Nyan Cat (5,130,000 views).\nRegardless, Domino\u2019s social media feeds have made one thing abundantly clear, a food photo doesn\u2019t have to be pretty to be beautiful.

{"idx": 478, "truncated_input": "The final chapter in Roy Andersson's droll trilogy 'on being a human being' introduces three dozen more brilliantly absurd vignettes.\nIn a Venice Film Festival lineup full of cynicism, suicide and despair, who would expect the new Roy Andersson picture \u2014 \u201cthe final part of a trilogy on being a human being\u201d \u2014 to be the most life-affirming? And yet, from its comic title to the wistful smile that accompanies its over-too-soon last shot, Andersson\u2019s delightfully odd \u201cA Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\u201d finds the Swedish master of comic absurdity feeling downright generous, perched at a comfortable enough distance from this coterie of sad sacks and lonelyhearts to recognize the humor in such painful subjects as mortality, aging, unpaid debts and unrequited love.\nJust last year, Ethan Hawke was quoted as referring to \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d and its two sequels as \u201cthe lowest-grossing trilogy in the history of motion pictures.\u201d But even he probably hasn\u2019t bought tickets to Andersson\u2019s incomparable triptych \u2014 rapturously received by critics, though audiences have proven all but allergic to the first two films, which have cleared barely $100,000 so far in the U.S. The result of four years of rigorous planning and meticulous execution, \u201cPigeon\u201d could fare slightly better than \u201cSongs From the Second Floor\u201d and \u201cYou, the Living\u201d (both of which bowed at Cannes), but only just. At least arthouse programmers can now get creative, treating Andersson\u2019s now-complete tragicomic opus, a decade and a half in the making, as the special event that it is.\n\u201cPigeon\u201d is by far the most accessible of the three films, offering a continuity throughline in the form of novelty salesmen Sam (Nils Westblom) and Jonathan (Holger Andersson), a comedic duo who\u2019d be right at home in a Samuel Beckett or Tom Stoppard play. Here, the Laurel-and-Hardy-esque pair appear in nearly one-third of the film\u2019s 37 fixed-camera compositions, a series of chuckle-inducing tableaux that clock in at just under three minutes apiece on average.\nEach of these shots serves as a nearly self-contained comic vignette, like a cross between a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo\u201d cartoon and a Gregory Crewdson photograph, and the best way to approach them is as you might a large-canvas painting or a Jacques Tati film: Study the faces, soak up the details, allow the eye to wander and the mind to free-associate. Where other directors seek out exceptional moments, Andersson endeavors to capture the poetry of the mundane.\nWith the exception of one scene, in which twin girls blow bubbles from the balcony of a nondescript apartment building, and another that observes a plumpish new mom (Andersson loves his ladies with a little meat on their bones) cooing over her baby carriage, all the characters here are adults. Most of them have fewer days ahead of them than they do behind, but none seem to truly appreciate the gift of living. Andersson does, and he wants us to recognize it, too.\nRight up front, the helmer presents three \u201cmeetings with death\u201d: a husband who suffers a heart attack while struggling to uncork a wine bottle; an old lady convinced she can take her handbag to heaven; and a cruise-ship passenger who collapses at the lunch counter, having just paid for his meal (sorry, no refunds). More playful than his fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, who famously challenged Death to a game of chess, Andersson recognizes that there\u2019s no cheating mortality \u2014 though sometimes we can speed it along, like the suicidal CEO glimpsed later in the film. Best just to have a sense of humor about it.\nSome critics have mistaken Andersson\u2019s movies as \u201cdepressing\u201d (while others have incorrectly labeled him a \u201ccommercials director,\u201d failing to understand that he accepted those commissions to finance his painstaking feature ventures). \u201cDroll\u201d would be a better word for the artist\u2019s attitude toward the washed-out blue and beige world he presents. His characters wear white face makeup to enhance their pallor, sleepwalking zombielike through their lives. Even the young couple seen necking on the beach appear to be doing so in slow-motion.\nIn the interval since his last film, Andersson has embraced hi-def digital cameras, which benefit his aesthetic enormously. Now, the helmer can ensure that even the far-distant background of every scene appears in sharp focus. Though the colors are dreary and the characters numb, compositionally speaking, there\u2019s not a single dull frame in the entire film. Andersson thinks like a painter, following Edward Hopper\u2019s example of enhancing loneliness by depicting it within a greater context. He shoots rooms at an angle, using perspective to direct our eyes toward the activity in adjacent rooms or on the other side of windows, instead of observing everything directly on axis, the way his similarly detail-oriented American namesake, Wes Anderson, insists on doing.\nIn \u201cPigeon,\u201d people go about their business in the dreary little boxes of their lives, but they don\u2019t behave like marionettes on strings, but almost like actors on a stage, occasionally turning to address the audience. \u201cToday I feel kind,\u201d announces a cheesemonger, while his wife gestures to the audience to let us know she thinks he\u2019s crazy.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the shift to digital has allowed Andersson to manipulate his footage the way directors such as David Fincher and Ruben Ostlund do, using their locked-down cameras to make invisible nips and tucks. Regardless of the method, the film is a master class in comic timing, employing pacing and repetition with the skill of a practiced concert pianist.\nEarly on, outside a dance studio where the flamenco teacher gets a little too hands-on with one of her pupils, a lady janitor says into her phone, \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d (Mobile phones are a rare nod to modern life in a film that appears to be set in a timeless retro past \u2014 and where King Charles XII and his infantry are prone to drop in unannounced, like characters in a Monty Python sketch.) The cleaning woman\u2019s line becomes a hollow platitude echoed by many of the characters by film\u2019s end, and yet, there\u2019s something to be said for merely surviving in such an absurd world as this.\nDown on their luck, Sam and Jonathan bill themselves as being in the \u201centertainment business,\u201d selling plastic vampire teeth and a corny laughing device engineered to amuse. These two friends look like they haven\u2019t smiled in a long, long time. Emerging as the most well-rounded character in the entire trilogy, Jonathan suffers from melancholy spells, culminating in a disturbing dream sequence, where colonial soldiers lead African slaves into a giant copper instrument that produces a beautiful sound as the people inside are being roasted alive. What a curious species are homo sapiens. Judging by the film, we wage war, torture animals and take advantage of one another, and yet, Andersson assures us, things could be worse. In the grand scheme of things, he\u2019s happy to show we\u2019re doing fine.\nProduction: (Sweden-Norway-France-Germany) A Roy Andersson Filmproduktion production, in co-production with 4 1/2 Fiksjon, Essentail Filmproduction, Parisienne de Production, Sveriges Television, Arte France Cinema, ZDF/Arte, with support from Svenska Filminstitutet, Eurimages Council of Europe,", "baseline_completion": "Nordisk Film- och TV Fond, Norska Filmfonden, Film- ind Medienstiftung NRW, CNC.

{"idx": 479, "truncated_input": "Steven Spielberg has Ready Player One officially out in theaters today and Carl's Jr. tried to get in on the marketing fun by renaming their new charbroiled sliders to \"SpielBurgers.\" The legendary director caught wind of the fast food chain's publicity stunt and quickly shut it down after admitting that the sliders tasted \"pretty good.\" Though Carl's Jr. never officially renamed their product, they're pretty happy that they got some kind of reaction out of Steven Spielberg with a semi-endorsement.\nCarl's Jr. posted a bunch of spoof videos on Twitter advertising the name change of their sliders to the \"SpielBurgers\" to help promote Ready Player One and their new product. The videos each take on some of the director's most famous work, from E.T. to Jurassic Park. The fast food chain even decided to take their guerilla campaign to the next level when they had some of the \"SpielBurgers\" delivered to Amblin Entertainment yesterday, which prompted Steven Spielberg to record a response video and post it to Twitter.\nThe fast food chain tweeted over the weekend about the name change in honor of Ready Player One and noted that Steven Spielberg hadn't signed off, but that they \"assume that he's cool with it.\" In addition to the burgers, an employee even left a letter on an Amblin executive's car. After Carl's Jr. delivered the \"SpielBurgers\" to Amblin, the director announced a cease and desist to the fast food chain after sort of complimenting the taste of their creations. Spielberg had this to say.\n\"It has recently come to my attention that Carl's Jr. wants to rename their charbroiled sliders SpielBurgers and they're pretty good, but I'm passing. Cease and desist. You can't do it - sorry, guys.\"\nThe publicity stunt worked out perfectly for Carl's Jr. They knew that Steven Spielberg would never sign off on the deal, but if they got any response from him, it would be well worth it. Not only did Spielberg respond, he recorded a video that stated that \"SpielBurgers\" were pretty good, resulting in free promotion for the fast food chain and Ready Player One. Obviously, Carl's Jr. is pretty happy with the outcome that", "baseline_completion": "they orchestrated. Though the note on the executive's car was a tad bit creepy.\nAs for official partnerships, Ready Player One teamed up with the extremely popular HQ Trivia app for a record breaking prize of $250,000. The trivia game will take place tonight, March 28th at 6:30 PM Pacific and 9:30 PM Eastern, to celebrate the release of the movie. As for Steven Spielberg actually eating Carl's Jr., that has to be a bit of a white lie. One cannot imagine one of the most legendary directors of all time eating that type of fast food, even though our president mows down McDonald's more than once a week.

They've even named a burger after KISS frontman Gene Simmons and have featured a bunch of celebrities in their ads, including Kate Upton and Kim Kardashian. In the meantime, Ready Player One, directed by Steven Spielberg, is set to hit theaters on March 29.

My first instinct was to recoil in failure, but I went easy on myself and just made sure I got back on the track the next (business) day.\nAnother important part of this challenge is logging your progress and being held ACCOUNTABLE.

{"idx": 483, "truncated_input": "The Mapes family of Effingham enjoy the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago with their children including their adopted children, Regino and Regina, who were born in the Philippines.\nMisty Mapes and her husband, Patrick, of Effingham always had a desire to add to their family through adoption.\nThat dream became a reality in part due to Gift of Adoption Fund, a nonprofit organization that provides financial support to families that need help to pay for the hefty cost of adopting a child.\nThe Mapes, who have two biological children, Braydon, 16, and Madison, 11, were able to adopt 8-year-old twins, Regina and Regino \u2014 who go by Ina and Ino \u2014 about a year ago from the Philippines. They received a $4,000 grant that helped them pay travel expenses to the Philippines to bring the children home.\nThough they had always had tossed around the idea of adoption, they were spurred to take action when their older son asked them about it a few years ago.\n\"He said, 'Hey. Can we adopt? I'd like to have a brother,\" Misty Mapes recalled.\nMisty Mapes, who works as a teacher, and Patrick, who is a dockworker, set about eliminating as many of their expenses as they could to save the $40,000 they would need to took to fund the adoption.\nThat final boost was provided by the Gift of Adoption Fund, which bridges the game when people are nearing the goal of completing the adoption, but need a little extra financial help to finalize it, said Marcy McKay, a La Grange resident and volunteer for the fund.\nThough they didn't need the financial help to adopt their children that the Gift of Adoption Fund provides, the McKays, who have three adopted children ages 14, 13, and 11, know how costly it is and are working to help other families adopt.\nIn November 2014, Bethany and Jared Crain got a call saying that they were matched with an expectant mother.\nWhile they were ecstatic that they could be adding to their family of three, they decided not to tell their 4-year-old that she could be getting a sibling.\n\"It's just so extremely expensive,\" said McKay. \"A lot of people don't have that kind of money.\"\nThe need on the part of children to have families is great, too. The fund estimates there are 140 million children around the world who are orphaned and 500,000 in the U.S. who are living in foster care and have no permanent family to call their own.\nThe goal of the fund is to inspire adoption by providing grants to qualified parents. Parents who seek grants are required to show that they have financial need and have already completed some of the steps needed to adopt such as working with a licensed agency and having a home study done.\nThe fund puts an emphasis on completing adoptions for children who may find it more difficult to be placed with a permanent family. Those children may be siblings, like Regina and Regino Mapes, children who are aging out, have medical needs or who may go into foster care.\nThe grants that are supplied by the nonprofit range from $3,500 to $7,500.\nJoan Schoon's desire to be a foster parent was born", "baseline_completion": "out of compassion and sympathy.\nAs a teenager, she remembers listening to her friends who were foster children complain about treatment they endured in some of their previous foster homes.\n\"They apply for the exact dollar amount they need and the grants are paid directly to the adoption agency,\" McKay said.\nThe fund was founded in 1996 by a couple who, like the McKays, felt thankful that they had the financial resources to pay for adopting children, and wanted to help other families who need the support, according to its website.\nShe said the group raises money through a variety of fundraisers such as cocktail parties and golf outings.\n\"It's such a compelling cause,\" said McKay, noting that many of their donations are in the $50 to $100 ranges.\n\"It's a perfect fit,\" she said.", "orig_sample_length": 987, "prompt_length": 787, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "of a desire to help children who are in need.

{"idx": 486, "truncated_input": "The Learning Network | What Have You Learned Playing Video Games?\nWhat Have You Learned Playing Video Games?\nWhat are your favorite video games? What do you think they have taught you?\nDo you think video games can help inspire social change? Have you ever played one that helped you understand a serious global problem?\nThis year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood\u2019s residents.\nThe project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts \u2014 known as serious games \u2014 once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx.\nOne speaker at this year\u2019s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He led the team of researchers responsible for the puzzle game Foldit, which sought to crowdsource a solution to a scientific problem. Foldit asked players to take on the role of a biochemist and map out how proteins might be folded in nature. The game provided scores based on how well they performed. Three papers in the journal Nature have been published, based on Foldit discoveries, since the game\u2019s release in 2008; the most famous, in 2011, explained how Foldit players had helped to decipher the structure of an AIDS-related enzyme, a problem that scientists had been trying to solve for years.\nMr. Popovic plans to unveil a new project this week, a synthetic-biology game called NanoCrafter, whose goal is to discover molecular structures that could benefit vaccine and cancer research.\n\u2014 What are your favorite video games? What games did you play when you were younger? Looking back, what do you think they taught you \u2014 whether physical or mental skills or something more intangible? How have they enriched your life?\n\u2014 Have you ever played a video game like the ones at Games for Change, in which the goal is \u201cmore than entertainment\u201d? What did you think of it? What did you learn?\n\u2014 Do you think video games can be effective tools for learning? Do you think playing them might actually help \u201cchange the world\u201d? Why or why not?\n\u2014 If your school were to invest in a \u201cvideo game for change\u201d that was, like the examples in this article, fun to play, intellectually enriching and altruistically focused, what would you like it to be about? How might it work?\nHonestly I have never really played video games before, well I have but not as much as an average teen. But that little that I did play I just learned little strategies and the games really made you think. But they are really not that productive.\nI used to play games a lot but i have slowed down playing them now. I actually have learnt a lot of things from certain video games like strategies, and my friend said that he learnt that rubber comes from trees.\nI think integrating games into school could be a good idea. It would probably be executed poorly in most areas though. There\u2019s a stigma against video games in general that label all games as bad for your brain and they make you do bad things.\nMy favorite video game has to be guitar hero. I think this game has taught me how to multitask with my hands. I think video games are very good and can help inspire social change, depending on the type of game. No, I have never played a video game that has helped inspire me to change a serious global problem.\nI don\u2019t like to play video games. I rather do something else than be in four hours play games that not be educated.\nthe video games i have played are strategic and would make me think. i have never played a video game that benefits a cause before so i would go with some of the concepts listed in the article when deciding on one for my school to invest in.\nThat\u2019s actually really interesting concept because most games are like what you guys said, fps and the like. there are a handful of games that are different or promote learning. i personally have not heard anything that could help with research.\nMy favorite video games are the grand theft auto video games. Not just because of the violence but also because I don\u2019t play very many video games and it\u2019s fun to just drive around and wander the game. When I was younger my favorite video game was a hand held analog stick with a few different games on it including PAC man. I don\u2019t believe that playing these types of video games benefits you much. I\u2019ve never played a more than entertainment goal game. But I think it\u2019s a very intriguing idea, especially scenes so many kids learn from their surroundings and technology now days.\nMy favorite video games are Minecraft, COD, Counterstrike Source, Guitar Hero, Farcry, and Rainbow six. Looking back at these games I have learned a little more about weaponry, and playing video games has also helped with my hand-eye corrdination. I also think playing video games can help increase your reflexes and response time. When I started playing Minecraft I immediately fell In love because it allowed me to use my creativity and build things that I\u2019ve always wanted to build. I think video games can be a very effective tool for learning because it makes learning fun. But I also think that it should be taken in moderation and staring a screen all day isn\u2019t that great for you and neither is sitting all day. The more interactive learning is the better it will be in general. I think that bringing video games into schools could be a good way to bring more interaction to learning.\nMy number one game is World of tanks. when i was younger, i played minecraft. I was a 4 year minecraft player.. Minecraft gave me inspiration. But when i got World of tanks, i quit minecraft. World of tanks has taught me alot. Ive learned alot since i started playing. No blood, no gore. Just fun with big metal machines.\nI don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t play video games.\nWell i have not learned a lot because i don\u2019t play a lot. It shows that there is violence in the world. Also how to help you shoot more acculturate. I think that if schools had games then more people could enjoy and relax more.\nI have played some games that teaches you life lessons and some games that inspires you. Video games nowadays have little education to offer for you if you are playing modern consoles.\nThe way i learned to play video games is that most people can easily play any game if they put their mind into it. i play video games every single day and beat every single game there is its just what i like to do everyday when i get home from school etc. i can play really hard games that not everyone can beat i\u2019m technically the best at playing horror games and war games plus games like assasins creed 1 to throughout all the other assasin creed games. i am such a video game expert i\u2019ve played every system that ever came out from the beginning of atari to all of todays games. i just love to play video games.\nI love playing video games with my brothers. I play Black Ops, Mine Craft, Kinect Sports and more. Playing these games explain more than moving your thumbs it showed you how to multitask and some of the video games keeps you physically active when you have a X-Box 360.\nIm a senior in High School. Im always playing video games whenever im not either at school, work, or golf. I love video games and I feel that they are a quintessential part of learning. I have played almost every game. Games like pokemon help you to solve problems. Games like portal cause you to use physics and puzzles to play the game. Games like the bioshock series or the half life series create stories, that in my opinion, are better than reading book because you get to experience it. Even games like Call of duty increases reflexes.\n\u2013 My favourite video games are Deus Ex, The Witcher 2 and Half-Life 2.\nAs someone who lives in germany, where most students don\u2019t speak english very good. I think video games taught me a lot about english. It was the only subject I NEVER had problems with. From the first day on I was too good for my grade.\n\u2013 I honestly have never played one of those games, but after this article I\u2019m definitely looking forward to them.\n\u2013 I don\u2019t know, maybe about subjects, that are boring and complicated for many students, like biology and chemistry? I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with an idea, but smart people, probably would.\nI play a lot of RPGs mostly. They are some of my favorite games. Most RPGs give you choices, and what choices you make affects the people, and world around you. Usually the choices range from good, to neutral, to evil. This is very similar to how life really is. The choices we make, whether they are good or bad, have a bigger impact on the world around us than we may think.\nmy favorite video games are games like Portal and Persona, games that actually require thinking while playing and not just mindless button mashing, the thing i think they\u2019ve taught me\u2026 that no matter who you are you can always be a hero if you put your mind to it!\nUnfortunately not, i would love to have the chance to be able to though, i believe that video games are more than just a way to distract ourselves or have a good time, i believe that the educational value of video games are much greater than what people believe.\nYes, video games are tools, whether the tool is used for entertainment or for education, it\u2019s full potential cannot be realized unless someone steps forward and says \u201clets try to use it like this!\u201d and works hard on that.\nI would like that many possibilities for interactive learning would open up, these interactive lessons would not only increase the amount of fun in a classroom, but also the amount of passion from students who can honestly say that the lessons spoke to them.\n@Alondra The correct sentence would be: I don\u2019t like to play video games. I Would rather do something else than playing four hours of video games that do not help with my education.\nI have played video games for years. All to often my choices were challenged or denied by my parents. At first I couldn\u2019t comprehend the difference or what were the deciding factors for their answer. As I\u2019ve grown older I see know how video games have the power to shape one\u2019s personality. Even in video games there are choices to be made, altruistic choices that can benefit another individual in the game or choices to eliminate your opponent. The choices are made in real life all to often and it\u2019s vital that children and teenagers recognized the value or consequences of the", "baseline_completion": "choices even within the games.\nI am impressed by the idea of Games for Change. If our school were to invest in such a game perhaps one that affords students the opportunity to understand how closely connected their games choices are to real life. A game that teaches altruistic behavior and choices while still having fun. We find a significant change and positive growth in our society through future generations.\nThe focus of the some games is to build what ever the mind can imagine. I think that games can be more than entertainment because it makes you think about things that you may have see in your life. It also could make you think of real building and structure around the world. Others games can make you think about real life world problems and make you aware that they are happening. They may also help influence what you do later in your life. Overall I think that some games can do more than just entertainment and can make you think about real things and ideas.", "orig_sample_length": 2764, "prompt_length": 2564, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "choices they make. I think video games are a good way to promote learning because they are so fun and they allow the potential for learning to be incorporated into the game.\nI don\u2019t really play video games. I like sims and that\u2019s about it.\nI\u2019m not really a gamer, but I do play video games. I play games that encourage you to use your imagination, like Minecraft. They also allow me to be creative and build stuff that I want. I feel like video games can teach you about a lot of different things. They can be entertaining and educating at the same time. I think that video games can be useful for learning. It can help people learn about things they don\u2019t know about.\nAs someone who is a bit of a gamer I think that video games can teach you a lot about life and different problems that you may face in life. I think that video games can also help the person", "w_wm_output": "decision they make. Video games should be a tool used to teach a young person how to make the right choices when it\u2019s time to decide.\n@Adam I believe the correct sentence is: I don\u2019t like to play video games. I would rather do something else than play four hours of video games that do not help with my education.\n@Alondra my mistake, i was just following the wording of the sentence in the article. Thanks for the correction!\nThe games have taught me many thing such as: strategy, time management and other thing. Video games are a fun way to pass time but also a fun way to learn. Video games can also be a learning tool. A person could sit at a computer for a few hours and learn a lot. I believe that playing video games can be a good learning tool for some people.

{"idx": 490, "truncated_input": "Touted as the world's \"most human\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that can \"read between the lines\" and \"understand emotional expressions\", Amelia has the potential to turn India's healthcare sector into an inclusive one, believes her creator Chetan Dube, CEO of New York-headquartered AI company IPsoft.\nAmelia got her name from Amelia Earhart, one of the pioneering women in American history who became the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932.\nThe tech Amelia combines automation, cognitive and emotional intelligence with Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to perform as a digital colleague.\nWhen Amelia was first created, her conversational abilities sent shockwaves in the AI community, raising fears of job losses, especially in countries like India where a large number of people are employed in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.\nBut Dube, who left a teaching job at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences 20 years ago to pursue a career in business, is unperturbed by the talk of job losses as he believes that AI would not displace as many jobs as it would help create.\n\"We are now at the third version of Amelia, a development process that has been going on for the last 15 years, and she is the industry's most advanced, conversational AI,\" Dube told IANS in an email interview.\n\"Not only does she communicate in over a 100 languages, she also has the ability to learn and improve over time which makes her the market's only AI that can fully adapt to new business requirements. She can automate any process in a business,\" he added.\nAmelia can be pre-trained to handle requests and questions related to HR, finance, IT and procurement. In fact, according to Dube, Amelia can be trained to handle almost any knowledge-based task.\n\"She helps customers open new bank accounts, process insurance claims and register patients for hospital entry. As a whisper agent, Amelia provides her human colleagues with a personalised conversational user interface (UI),\" said Dube, who thinks Amelia can do wonders in transforming India's healthcare sector.\n\"Amelia allows patients to self-manage in scheduling doctors' appointments, tests and medicines. She can also offer condition-specific advice and well-curated health management tips.\n\"A robust digital colleague like Amelia can free caregivers from high-volume patient needs to provide specialised care for unique or pressing concerns, while subsequently providing patients with enhanced 24/7 access to medical services,\" Dube explained.\n\"AI and Amelia are vital for an inclusive and democratic healthcare sector and could have an enormous impact,\" he added.\nAccording to him, common AI assistants like Alexa, Cortana and Siri cannot read between the lines. They cannot understand underlying meanings or emotional expressions. Even when it comes to more advanced AI, the majority of these virtual assistants lack capabilities of contextualising information as people do, he said.\n\"When customers or employees interact with Amelia, they don't feel they are interacting with something artificial due to her advanced empathetic abilities, capacity to switch context and channels, and intelligent responses. Amelia is the only AI on the market that offers all of these features with expert-level accuracy and emotional intelligence,\" Dube noted.\nIPsoft, Dube said, is now exploring opportunities with a number of agencies in digital health programmes, to accelerate technology adoption which will take pressure off of the human workforce while maintaining and improving services.\nThe company, which has 16 offices in 13 countries, including one in Bengaluru, helps with the digitisation process required in an organisation to deploy Amelia and make her work.\n\"It is a crucial part of our work to make sure our clients have the right prerequisites to implement Amelia.

{"idx": 495, "truncated_input": "It\u2019s immediately clear that Parquet Courts aren\u2019t done now, not by a long chalk. Based in Brooklyn, Savage and his bandmates \u2013 guitarist and fellow songwriter Austin Brown, bassist Sean Yeaton and Savage\u2019s younger brother Max on drums \u2013 have been releasing excellent punk-rock records defined by venom, groove and lyrics that make you wish you read more books since their 2011 debut \u2018American Specialties\u2019.\nIf 2012\u2019s \u2018Light Up Gold\u2019 woke the world up to a group that many touted as the latest answer to The Strokes, \u2018Wide Awake!\u2019 is an indelible underlining of their status as one of the most important bands in the world right now. Before we continue, a mildly surprising fact: this record was produced by 19-time Grammy nominee Danger Mouse, whose CV includes The Black Keys, A$AP Rocky, Norah Jones. Far from softening Parquet Courts\u2019 edges, he has enhanced everything that makes the quartet great \u2013 sound, imagination, style. The Beastie Boys, Black Flag and Talking Heads are all here in spirit.\n\u2018Violence\u2019 is the first standout, a mazy, bassy call to arms. Like many of Parquet Courts\u2019 best songs, it functions as an alarm clock, a cattle prod. \u201cViolence is daily life,\u201d they chant, Savage considering the \u201cpornographic spectacle of black death\u201d that is the human condition. But the frontman is there for the listener too, offering us his hand as he spits, \u201cSavage is my name because Savage is how I feel\u2026 My name belongs to us all\u2026 My name is a threat\u201d.\nThis band have long articulated the inertia of acclimatising to adult life, and \u2018In And Out Of Patience\u2019 \u2013 a classic Parquet number \u2013 does so almost flippantly. \u201cI\u2019m neither here nor there,\u201d muses Savage. It\u2019s there again on the breakneck \u2018Extinction\u2019, Savage poking fun at his daily existence (\u201cI\u2019m trying not to turn into a psychopath\u201d) over impatient guit", "baseline_completion": "ars.\nAustin Brown\u2019s contributions (\u2018Mardi Gras Beads\u2019\u2019 dreamy textures, the spacey, desperate \u2018Back To Earth\u2019, maudlin jam \u2018Death Will Bring Change\u2019) take their time with their introspection, but cut just as hard. By the time the record spins through the pepped-up \u2018Freebird II\u2019, the irresistible carnival feel of the title-track and the piano-driven stomp of closer \u2018Tenderness\u2019, you\u2019re left winded by its brilliance.\nParquet Courts are a magical band that make you feel everything all at once: youth, nostalgia, happiness, desolation, flying high, running low. The record\u2019s last line, then, is fitting, Savage calling for \u201cthe fix of a little tenderness\u201d.

The \u201cloyalty\u201d of the title track is a bloodstained kiss-off to the \u201cfake friends\u201d who couldn\u2019t handle the band\u2019s success. \u2018Freedom\u2019 is a historical march, a celebration of black figures from the past, while \u2018Wide Awake\u2019, with its references to the internet, is a drug-addled, frenetic look at how we live now. \u201cI\u2019ve been wide awake for so long,\u201d Savage sings, \u201cand now I\u2019m wide awake and the sun is coming up\u201d.", "w_wm_output": "ars.\nBut this isn\u2019t all no-nonsense, no-shit rock and roll.

{"idx": 496, "truncated_input": "The controversial $3 billion corporate tax initiative Measure 97 went down in defeat, according to partial election returns Tuesday night.\nMeasure 97 was failing 58 percent to 42 percent as of 9:50 p.m.\nThe defeat follows a hard-fought campaign that broke Oregon's spending record for ballot initiatives and pitted business interests against the state's largest public employee unions.\nMeasure 97 would charge certain C corporations a 2.5 percent tax on their gross annual sales in Oregon above $25 million. The measure called for the state to spend the new revenue on education, health care and senior services.\nSupporters of Measure 97 were still figuring out how to respond Tuesday night. Ben Unger, executive director of the union-affiliated group Our Oregon which backed the measure, suggested a different tax proposal might have fared better with voters. \"Clearly, we learned the tonight that the details weren't right,\" Unger said. However, when a reporter asked if the tax rate proposed in Measure 97 was too high, Unger said \"I would be surprised if you talked to very many voters that found that that was the problem.\"\nPat McCormick, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat the tax, said Measure 97 \"fell of its own weight when people understood what it would do\" and now it's up to state officials to come up with proposals to balance the state budget. \"The business community does have members that are very much committed to finding routes to go forward,\" McCormick said.\nState economists in the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office estimated the tax would raise at least $6 billion for every two-year spending cycle, a 33 percent increase in tax revenue going to the state's current $18 billion general fund budget. That would have been the largest tax increase in Oregon's history, at least by dollar amount, according to Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner.\nThose potential tax hits -- and the promise of new revenue for government services -- spurred businesses and public employee unions to the highest level of campaign spending in Oregon history.\nAs of Friday, opponents reported raising $25.9 million, while supporters reported $16.4 million. The previous record for the costliest Oregon campaign was set in 2014, when opponents of a measure to label genetically modified foods spent nearly $21 million with supporters spending $8 million.\nMeasure 97 started out with 60 percent support in a poll taken a year ago. A poll in September found the same level of support. But by mid-October it had eroded down to 46 percent and by the end of the month only 40 percent of respondents to one poll said they'd vote for it.\nThe central debate throughout the campaign was whether corporations or consumers would end up paying the cost of the tax -- and how much.\nA study by economists in the Legislative Revenue Office found businesses would pass on part of the tax in the form of higher prices, and a typical Oregon family might wind up paying $600 a year. Grocery stores and other low-margin businesses said they would be forced to raise prices, because the 2.5 percent tax would obliterate their slim profit margins.\nSupporters of the measure said no economic modeling -- including in a study they funded, by Portland State University economists -- could accurately estimate the impact of the measure.\nThe backers argued it was too different from gross receipts taxes in other states.

Kate Brown, lawmakers, public employee unions and the business community now face the challenge of coming together after the bruising battle to address the state's ongoing challenges.\nVoters' rejection of Measure 97 means the governor and lawmakers must now pass a tax increase, budget cuts or some combination to fill a projected $1.35 billion budget shortfall in the next two-year budget.

Similar proposals have been tried on the national level as well as in California and Washington state.\nThe Oregon Legislature has been struggling with a budget crisis that could worsen next year as federal public lands revenue shrinks. Democrats in the Oregon House have proposed a new tax on some business profits and the state's top economic adviser has been recommending a series of tax increases.

{"idx": 498, "truncated_input": "USC announced Thursday it would appeal NCAA sanctions it considers \"excessive.\" And even before those plans became official, Trojans football coaches were calling recruits and getting out the message that the penalties could be reduced.\n\"They're trying to appeal it and at least cut it in half,\" said incoming freshman Giovanni Di Poalo, an offensive lineman from Ventura St. Bonaventure High who said he spoke to Trojans line coach James Cregg.\nHowever, if recent history is any indication, Trojans players and fans shouldn't get their hopes up.\nSince a key change to an NCAA bylaw was made in January 2008, only one in 11 appeals has been successful.\nThe change: An appeal will be granted only if the offended party shows \"the penalty is excessive such that it constitutes an abuse of discretion\" by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.\nBefore, an appeal could be won if, upon review, it was determined that a penalty was inappropriate based on the evidence and circumstances.\n\"It's a tougher standard to meet,\" said Mike Glazier, the head of Collegiate Sports Practice group at the Kansas office of Bond, Schoeneck & King, who for 20 years has been working with universities during the NCAA investigation process. \"It was changed for that purpose \u2014 to make it harder to be successful on appeal.\"\nUSC officials were not commenting specifically about their appeal plans Thursday, but the university released a letter from school President Steven B. Sample addressed to \"Members of the Trojan Family,\" and in it he said he \"sharply\" disagreed \"with many of the conclusions reached by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.\"\nAmong those conclusions was that USC knew or should have known that star running back Reggie Bush and members of his family were receiving extra benefits from would-be marketers and prospective sports agents in violation of NCAA rules. As a result, the Trojans' football program was hit hard \u2014 too hard, the university feels \u2014 with penalties including 14 vacated victories, a two-year ban from participating in bowl games and a loss of 30 scholarships.\n\"\u2026monitoring and regulating human behavior is complex at best,\" Sample's letter continued. \"\u2026In this environment, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can\u2026to protect our students, their families \u2014 and ultimately the university \u2014 from unscrupulous sports agents and others who seek to exploit our elite student-athletes or their families.\"\nUSC's stance is that violations with Bush took place \u2014 but they had no way of knowing about them. Bush has denied wrongdoing from the time allegations surfaced years ago.\nGlazier said such an appeal would be \"a pretty big uphill battle.\" He added: \"Just to be successful on appeal because you claim the penalties are too harsh, your chances are not very good.\"\nMichael Buckner, a Florida-based attorney and private investigator who has worked on NCAA cases, agreed that \"most of the penalties\" would be upheld. However, he said the loss of 10 scholarships a year \"might be excessive,\" noting that the NCAA usually reduces scholarships at the rate of two for every one ineligible player.\nBuckner, a USC alumnus, said it appeared to him the infractions committee \"did what they should have done and imposed the appropriate penalties\" considering USC's status as a repeat offender that was failing to properly monitor its athletes.\nBuckner's firm represented Alabama State \u2014 the only school to be successful with an appeal since the bylaw was changed.\nThat change was prompted, experts say, by a string of successful appeals that overturned certain aspects of sanctions against Oklahoma (2008), Ohio State (2007), Georgia (2005), Georgia Tech (2004) and Michigan (2003).\nNCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn said the bylaw change was \"part of the normal legislative process to constantly be evaluating what is happening in our structure and what's being addressed and what's being successful.\"\nAlabama State had its penalty of five years probation for widespread academic fraud shortened to three years in 2009 after Buckner's firm asked the appeals committee to consider", "baseline_completion": "how federal and state courts had defined \"abuse of discretion.\"\nNot based on a correct legal standard or was based on a misapprehension of the underlying legal principles.\nBased on a clearly erroneous factual finding.\nFailed to consider and weigh material factors.\nBased on a clear error of judgment, such that the imposition was arbitrary, capricious or irrational.\nBased in significant part on one or more irrelevant or improper factors.\nThat the NCAA would toughen rules on appeals came as no surprise to its membership.\n\"It's like anything,\" said Brian Battle, the compliance director at Florida State, which had an appeal denied in January. \"Any time somebody wins something, they'll say, 'Where did we \u2026 do something that caused this separate group of people to overturn the decision?\"\nTimes staff writers Mike Hiserman and Eric Sondheimer contributed to this report.", "orig_sample_length": 1197, "prompt_length": 997, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the school's previous history of compliance.

{"idx": 502, "truncated_input": "The personal squabbling over the career of a ballet prodigy continued Monday when the mother of 15-year-old Misty Copeland dropped a request for a temporary restraining order against the girl's two instructors, but said she still wanted the couple to stay away from her daughter.\nAlso complicating Misty's future were emancipation proceedings she had initiated against her mother, Sylvia DelaCerna. Monday, Torrance Superior Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz said the girl had told her she wanted to discontinue them.\nThe Los Angeles dance community is watching the machinations closely. Misty won a prestigious Spotlight Award in ballet as the best young dancer in Los Angeles this year despite less than three years of dance experience. The victory caught the attention of professional dance companies, including the famed Joffrey Ballet.\nAfter meeting with attorneys in her chambers for nearly 45 minutes, the judge dismissed DelaCerna's motion for separate restraining orders against dance instructors Patrick and Cynthia Bradley as well as against the Los Angeles attorney who filed the emancipation case on Misty's behalf.\nDelaCerna had filed for the restraining orders because she said the Bradleys, who had taken Misty into their home for more than two years for dance training, had brainwashed her daughter into filing for her legal freedom. She alleged that they had only financial motives in mind.\nMonday's developments appeared to have had little effect on the tense custody standoff.\nSpeaking before more than a dozen news cameras and reporters outside the courthouse following the judge's ruling, DelaCerna's attorney, Gloria Allred, said she expected the Bradleys to honor a sworn promise made in court declarations that they only wanted what was best for Misty and would \"abide by any decision the family makes.\"\n\"After a great deal of thought, Misty's mother has determined that it will be in Misty's best interest not to have any further contact with Cynthia and Patrick Bradley,\" Allred said.\nEarlier, the Bradleys told reporters that they still had a personal management contract with Misty--an agreement signed by the dancer's mother--that gave them exclusive rights to manage her career, as well as a 20% cut of her earnings, minus expenses, until her 18th birthday.\n\"Our contract is still in full bloom,\" Cynthia Bradley said. \"We hope to continue to manage Misty's career and be her teachers. Eventually, we hope to see her on every stage around the world.\"\nWhen asked about the contract, Allred said, \"We believe that contract is voidable. We don't believe it's enforceable and we won't be honoring it.\"\nIn dismissing the motions, Smaltz said the case revolved around \"individual rights that emphasize personal success over the family unit or family", "baseline_completion": "togetherness.\"\nShe said it was Misty's desire to live with her mother and not pursue emancipation.\nSmaltz added that in a closed-door meeting last week, Misty told her she wanted the parties to sit down privately and resolve their differences over her career.\nBut DelaCerna said Monday that wouldn't be happening.\nReading from a statement, she said, \"I love my daughter immensely and will continue to support her in her dance career,\" adding that Misty will continue taking lessons at a Torrance dance school, away from the Bradleys.\nMisty also recited from a brief statement, saying, \"I am happy that this is over and I can continue with my dancing.\"\nBut in answer to reporters' questions, she seemed less sure of her words.\n\"I've always wanted everyone to get along,\" she said.", "orig_sample_length": 894, "prompt_length": 694, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "dynamic.\"\n\"The court and the community are going to have to sit back and wait for this to work out,\" Smaltz said. \"If it works out, it will be a real positive thing for the community and for Misty. If it doesn't work out, we're going to have a very sad situation. But I can't decide which way it's going to go.\"\nMisty Copeland, 15, has been dancing for only three years and has never performed in a major ballet company, but she has already attracted the attention of the Joffrey Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and others, who have sent representatives to watch her perform.\nThe girl's mother said she filed for Misty's legal emancipation after she and her daughter had a disagreement involving Misty's dancing schedule.\n", "w_wm_output": "unity.\"\nMisty has had a tempestuous relationship with the Los Angeles dance community. At the time of her Spotlight Award win and subsequent national exposure, she was still a student at the Ballet Academy East in New York.\nMisty has been a dancer for just three years, and critics have wondered how a dancer so young could have such talent.\nThe girl's mother initially said she was against Misty's moving out to train with the Bradleys. She did so after a series of meetings with the couple and an agent at the Bradleys' studio in the San Gabriel Valley.\nDelaCerna, who has a 16-year-old daughter who dances, said she had \"complete confidence\" in the Bradleys as instructors.

In 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal also ordered that the project be reconsidered because of inadequate consultations with affected First Nations.\nThe House of Commons was supposed to spend the day debating a Conservative opposition-day motion about threats to the Canadian economy.\nThe Liberals are under pressure from Western Canadian premiers and Conservative MPs to find a solution to the oil-price crisis, which the Alberta government estimates is costing the country $80 million a day.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Western Canadian Select was trading at US$27.95 a barrel, a US$11 increase from Dec. 3. In contrast, West Texas Intermediate Crude (WTI) was trading at US$53.13.\nThe price increase comes two days after Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced her government will cut oil production by 8.7 per cent starting Jan. 1. Notley has also said Alberta is willing to purchase enough train cars and locomotives to move up to 120,000 barrels of oil by rail a day.\nNotley has repeatedly asked the federal government for help, including a request that Ottawa amend or halt two pending pieces of energy-related legislation (one dealing with environmental assessments, the other a proposed tanker ban on the B.C. coast) that are currently under consideration in the Senate.\nBoth Prairie governments and industry have warned that the two pieces of legislation, which are backed by environmentalists and several Indigenous communities, could halt investment in the energy sector.\nIn an open letter to the prime minister sent Tuesday, Notley and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said the price discount must be put on the agenda of Friday\u2019s meeting of first ministers in Montreal.\n\u201cAs proposed, the meeting agenda does not include any discussion on the crisis facing the energy industry and the price differential that is crippling the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Canadian economy,\u201d the letter reads.\n\u201cA crisis of this magnitude must be reflected in any discussion on \u2018economic competitiveness,\u2019 \u201d the letter continues.\nPremier @RachelNotley and I have formally asked PM @JustinTrudeau to include oil differential crisis on agenda at upcoming First Ministers mtg this week.\nWhen asked about the premiers\u2019 letter, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office replied in an email that the oil differential was \u201calways going to be part of the discussion,\u201d given the matter relates to topics already on the meeting\u2019s agenda, such as competitiveness, jobs and trade diversification.\nIn an open letter published in the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald on Tuesday, Alberta MP and Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet So", "baseline_completion": "hi said \u201ca perfect storm\u201d is behind the current price differential.\n\u201cI know how painful this differential is,\u201d he wrote, but said his government is working with Alberta and Saskatchewan to find solutions to it.\nSohi repeated his instructions to the National Energy Board, asking it to produce a report on current pipeline use and efficiencies. The minister has said he wants to know if more capacity exists in the current pipeline system.\nEarlier this year, the Trudeau government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline from Texas-based Kinder Morgan. But construction has stalled after the Federal Court of Appeal said in August that the environmental assessment was flawed and more consultation was needed with Indigenous Canadians.\nIn 2016, the Trudeau government also approved Enbridge\u2019s Line 3 project to replace the existing pipeline located between Hardisty, Alta., and Gretna, Man.", "orig_sample_length": 1013, "prompt_length": 813, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "hi said the federal government has already taken \u201csignificant steps\u201d to address the crisis.\nHe highlighted the government\u2019s investments in pipelines (including the Trans Mountain expansion and Enbridge Line 3) and support for getting oil to tidewater (including the proposed Energy East pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion).

A good example of what happens in a slowdown of EPS and GDP growth is the 2014-2016 stock-market environment, where we had several quarters with negative EPS growth (see chart).

In fact, the last time the S&P 500 declined by more than 4% in December was 1990, when it fell 5.9%.\nI don\u2019t want to make too much of the average December decline of 4.4% for the S&P 500, especially when we\u2019re only talking about data going back to 1928.

What explains the disconnect?\nIt\u2019s a good question. I have heard many explanations:\nWe have had a credit crisis. In the third quarter, credit was one of the 14 sectors that the economy grew on a year-over-year basis, and yet the crisis continued to rage throughout the quarter.

{"idx": 508, "truncated_input": "In November, Dubai won its bid to host the World Expo 2020. The city beat competition from Ekaterinburg in Russia, Izmir in Turkey and Sao Paolo in Brazil. Although the decision wasn't widely reported around the world, here in Dubai, the city went crazy.\nThe announcement was made late evening our time, and within minutes, the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, was lit up by fireworks. Shortly after that, the ruler, Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al-Matktoum, announced that all schools were to be given the day off in celebration.\nThe last-minute decision created a flurry of activity, as schools desperately tried to contact parents letting them know; messages flew around on email and text from schools, but in reality, the children were way ahead of the adults, and already contacting their mates with the news over BBM, text, and Skype.\nSo what does this mean for Dubai and the UAE? Well, the emirate will spend $7bn on the direct infrastructure it needs for Expo 2020 and it is likely to create around 277,000 jobs between now and 2021, when the six-month exhibition finishes.\nIt means more people coming here to live and work, more visas being processed, more companies bidding for work or supplying services and as this business activity increases, quietly in the background, it means data. Lots of data. Data on spending, on new residents, on schemes to prepare for the Expo, on the utility needs this sudden growth creates and so on.\nFor the IT industry, the surge in the data that companies want to analyse means more demand for software, hardware and services.\nDubai and the wider UAE recovered pretty quickly from the economic downturn. It kept spending on big infrastructure schemes and benefited economically from some of the tragedy happening elsewhere in the Arab world, as people fled conflict to set up home here. So, in big data terms, technology companies were already highlighting the UAE as among the fastest growing in the region.\nExpats, for instance, have to send their children to private schools over here, as state schools are open only to locals. The emirate's Knowledge and Human Development Authority, which oversees education, says there are 153 private schools in Dubai, educating more than 225,000 students across 15 curricula (such as the English, American or Indian national curriculum).\nPrivate schools cater to almost 89 percent of Dubai's population and due to their reputation, around 43 percent of local students also attend private schools.\nSo, as the emirate's companies employ more people, you can guarantee that those who run the private schools are crunching the numbers as they try and estimate how many extra places will be needed over the next seven years, in which curricula they are likely to enrol and seeking trends in educational practices that can be adopted as they accommodate the rising student population. And so it will be for every other industry.\nAnalyst firm IDC recently predicted before the win that investment in business analytics in the Middle East is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20 percent over the next five years. Just over 40 percent of CIOs in the Middle East, it said, are considering investments in analytics and big data technologies.\nThe UAE, it added, \"has been at the forefront of business analytics and big data adoption across the Middle East\".\nThe company said 58 percent of CIOs cited governance, regulation and compliance requirements, transparency, and reporting as key reasons for investing in big data and analytics technologies.\nEMC research also points to growing awareness of data analytics in the UAE. Its survey among 237 IT decision makers in the country found that 87 percent of respondents thought decision making within their company could be improved through better use of data, with 67 percent saying that senior managers trust the insights such analysis provides when making important business decisions.\nFurther, 45 percent felt they had gained a competitive edge over a rival through big data analytics, with 67 percent stating that organisations that use such tools will be the ones that succeed. However, 27 percent of those surveyed said they have no plans to use big data technology and 57 percent said the lack of a clear business case or proven return on investment was the most common reason for not adopting it.\nSo, while a quarter of companies are yet to be convinced, big data has the attention of the region's IT heads. It is more a case of coming, rather than arrived, but is still good news for all those involved in the industry. Third-party data centres for instance, are still an emerging industry in the Middle East, albeit now in the latter stages (and in the UAE, established).\nUAE neighbour Saudi Arabia, for instance, is also investing heavily. It has some pretty strict rules about where data can be held and as the region's engine of growth, datacentres could become big business. IDC reports that by the end of this year, the kingdom's IT spending will have reached $1.09bn, up 15.1 percent on 2012. Much of that is going into datacentres and IT as a service business models.\nSo a growing economy is positive for future business, but it is likely to quickly uncover the fact that while data sets grow, the skills to analyse it, at least initially, won't keep pace.

{"idx": 509, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Companies involved in U.S. construction plan on intensifying their involvement in green building over the next three years, according to the new World Green Building Trends Study from Dodge Data & Analytics, conducted with support from United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) and its UTC Climate, Controls & Security business. The U.S. is also one of the global leaders in the percentage of firms expecting to construct new green institutional projects and green retrofits of existing buildings.\nThe global study, which received additional support from Saint-Gobain, the U.S. Green Building Council and the Regenerative Network, positions the U.S. as a strong participant in the global green movement. Responses from more than 1,000 building professionals from 60 countries place the U.S. green industry in context. The study also provides specific comparisons with 12 other countries from which a sufficient response was gained to allow for statistical analysis: Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom.\nAccording to the report, U.S. construction should see an increase in the share of green work in the next few years, largely as a result of companies intensifying their involvement in the green building industry. An increasing percentage of respondents projected that more than 60 percent of their projects would be green projects - from 24 percent of respondents in 2015 to 39 percent in 2018. Respondents projecting that fewer than 15 percent of their projects would be certified green plummeted from 41 percent in 2015 to 27 percent by 2018.\nWhile this increased share of green building is impressive, it is significantly less than many developing countries included in the survey. For example, Brazil expects six-fold growth (from 6 percent to 36 percent) in the percentage of companies conducting a majority of their projects green; five-fold growth is expected in China (from 5 percent to 28 percent); and four-fold growth is expected in Saudi Arabia (from 8 percent to 32 percent).\n\"The strong U.S. industry for green building projects is clearly an opportunity for U.S. firms, but so is the rapid rise of green in many of the developing countries,\" said Stephen Jones, Senior Director of Industry Insights, Dodge Data & Analytics. \"Expertise from experienced green designers, builders and manufacturers from the U.S. is likely to be essential to support the aggressive green building expectations revealed by the study respondents.\"\nIn the U.S., the highest percentage of respondents report that they expect to work on new green institutional projects (such as schools, hospitals and public buildings), green retrofits of existing buildings and new green commercial construction (such as office and retail buildings) in the next three years. When compared with global averages, it becomes clear that the U.S. is a leader in new green institutional construction and green retrofits of existing buildings.\n43 percent of U.S. respondents plan to work on green retrofits of existing buildings, again well above the global average of 37 percent.\nThe U.S. is also distinguished from the global findings in terms of the importance it places on reducing energy consumption as an environmental reason for building green. Over three quarters (76 percent) of U.S. respondents consider this important, nearly double the percentage of the next most important environmental factor, which is reducing water consumption. While the other 12 countries in the study prioritize the reduction of energy consumption, only Germany, Poland and Singapore do so to the same extent.\n\"The survey shows that global green building activity continues to double every three years,\" said United Technologies Chief Sustainability Officer John Mandyck. \"More people recognize the economic and productivity value that green buildings bring to property owners and tenants, along with the energy and water benefits to the environment, which is driving the green building industry's growth. It's a win-win for people, planet and the economy.\"\nThe study demonstrates the benefits of building green, with median operating cost decreases for green buildings of 9 percent expected in just one year globally. Building owners also report seeing a median increase of 7 percent in the value of their green buildings compared to traditional buildings, an increase that is consistent between newly built green buildings and those that are renovated green. These business benefits are a critical driver for the growth of green building anticipated globally.\nThe U.S. is also notable for having the lowest percentage of respondents who report that their company uses metrics to track green building performance. Only 57 percent of U.S. respondents report using metrics, compared to a 75 percent average globally. This may be linked to the fact that the U.S. is also the country with the highest level of concern reported about higher perceived first costs for green building, notably more than the percentage who consider this an important challenge to green in other developed countries with active construction markets like Germany and the U.K.\nDodge Data & Analytics is the leading provider of data, analytics, news and intelligence serving the North American construction industry.

{"idx": 511, "truncated_input": "Debutant Andrew Tye registered the second hat-trick of the day as a clinical Gujarat Lions defeated Rising Pune Supergiant by seven wickets to notch up their first win in the ongoing Indian Premier League, here today.\nOpting to bowl first, right-arm pacer Tye, playing his first IPL match, returned with impressive figures of 5 for 17 from his four overs to enable Gujarat Lions restrict Supergiant to 171 for eight.\nTye's was the second hat-trick of the day in the history of IPL after Royal Challengers Bangalore's Samuel Badree (4/9) achieved the feat earlier against Mumbai Indians in a losing cause.\nTye was instrumental in keeping the Supergiant's total under check, especially after a blazing start by opener Rahul Tripathi (33 off 17) and skipper Steven Smith (43 off 28).\nLater chasing the target, Brendon McCullum (49 off 32) and Dwayne Smith (47 off 30) got Gujarat Lions off to a flier with a blazing 94-run opening stand to set the base for the convincing victory.\nSkipper Suresh Raina (35 not out) and Aaron Finch (33 not out) then joined hands and stitched an unbeaten 61-run fourth wicket stand to overwhelm the target with two overs to spare.\nFinch finished off the proceedings in great style, clobbering Lockie Ferguson for two huge hits over the fence to get Gujarat Lions' campaign back on track after defeats in the opening two matches.\nChasing the challenging total, Gujarat Lions got off to a blazing start with McCullum and Dwayne Smith sharing qucikfire 94 runs for the opening stand in just 53 balls.\nBoth McCullum and Dwayne Smith looked in murderous mood as they mostly dealt fours and sixes. The duo didn't spare a single Supergiant bowler as they effortlessly struck boundaries and sixes.\nSupergiant finally manged to put some brakes on the Gujarat Lions' scoring rate when Shardul Thakur dismissed Dwayne Smith in the ninth over, caught at third man by Rahul Chahar.\nDwayne Smith scored his runs off 30 balls with the help of eight boundaries and one six.\nThe fall of Dwayne Smith's wicket resulted in another two overs later when a charging McCullum was stumped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni off leg-spinner Chahar's bowling.\nNew man in Dinesh Karthik too didn't last long as he chopped on Imran Tahir's googly on to his stumps in the next over.\nEarlier electing to bowl, Gujarat Lions got off to a prefect start as veteran Praveen Kumar (1/51) removed dangerous Ajinkya Rahane for a duck with the third ball of the innings.\nThe credit for the dismissal should go to Gujarat Lions skipper Raina who pulled off a one-handed blinder at the first slip from a good length delivery that came in after pitching and cramped the batsman for room only to induce an outside edge.\nThereafter, Supergiant skipper Smith and Tripathi took the attack to the opposition and stitched quick 63-run partnership off just 32 balls to take Gujarat Lions forward.\nTripathi smacked Praveen for two consecutive sixes and a four and then Smith hit the bowler two consecutive boundaries to pick up 25 runs from the fifth over.\nBut Tye put the brakes on the scoring with a slower delivery by removing the dangerous-looking Tripathi in his first over as the batsman went for another huge hit only to lift the ball as far as mid-off into the safe hands of Finch.\nSmith was the next to depart when he mistimed a Dwayne Smith delivery to Finch at long-on with the Supergiant scoreboard reading 89 for two in 9.2 overs.\nTye once again came tothe party when he went through the defence of Ben Stokes in the 13th over.

Tye was at his effective as he deceived the batsmen, who went for big shots, with best with his slower balls that includes his famous knuckle delivery.\nTye was unlucky not to get his sixth wicket of
