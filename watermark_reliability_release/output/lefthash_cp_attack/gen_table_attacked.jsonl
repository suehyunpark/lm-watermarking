{"idx": 1, "truncated_input": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt\u2019s an experience that might humble some. But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the", "baseline_completion": "draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.", "orig_sample_length": 566, "prompt_length": 366, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "charts.

But he admitted he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll run it Saturday.\n\u201cThey\u2019re still trying to tell me to run it,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to run it. It\u2019s a business.\nButler has been in Indianapolis for the past four days. He\u2019s been working out with the likes of Terry McLaurin (Ohio State), A.J.

Just tell me I\u2019m not gonna go to jail.\u201d After that, Butler missed a team meeting and had a 34-day suspension.\nFollow Backstory on YouTube and Instagram (@backstoryonnfl).\nThis week at the Combine, Butler\u2019s career trajectory has been trending in the right direction.\nIn Indianapolis, Butler is getting a tour of the league.

{"idx": 3, "truncated_input": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in", "baseline_completion": "the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon.", "orig_sample_length": 1013, "prompt_length": 813, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the district.\nThe county has also committed to spending an additional $36 million on infrastructure improvements relating to the Amazon project.\nAmazon is paying a lease of $2.5 million per year for about 100,000 square feet of space at the Crystal City Gateway building. The county has agreed to give the company a 10- to 15-year tax abatement on that property, but only if it occupies the entire building. The abatement would be worth about $11 million for Amazon.\nArlington has an estimated 40,000 vacant square feet of office space in the Crystal City and Pentagon City area with 1.8 million square feet of space.\nMost of the Amazon jobs will be high-paying, starting at $150,000 a year. The jobs will not exceed 150", "w_wm_output": "the district, too.\nAmazon\u2019s arrival will bring economic, environmental and social benefits to Arlington, said County Manager Mark Schwartz. He said officials wanted to ensure that those who stand to gain from the project have a voice at decision-making sessions.\n\u201cWe have had a lot of opportunities for the public to participate in the HQ2 process,\u201d he said.\nLinda S. Levine, president of the Arlington County Civic Federation, said it is clear that \u201cArlington residents who have engaged in the HQ2 process generally support HQ2 coming to Arlington, at least in general terms.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is the process by which we can address the specific concerns that some of our residents have?\u201d she said.\nBoard member Christian Dorsey said he hopes that

{"idx": 10, "truncated_input": "This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of", "baseline_completion": "toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail\u2014that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey.

Few will praise this hire. Many will scoff.\nFor those who understand the nuance of the Product Problem, this move will be music to their ears.\nDear Mark, fantastic and spot on post. It is amazing to be witnessing a great company waking up to the Product Problem.\nI am curious how you think about the impact of a company like Walmart on its suppliers.

Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland. There was \u201csome follow-up\u201d and it was assigned to a detective who was \u201cworking to build a case against our suspect at that time,\u201d Brophy said. The police chief would not go into further details about what happened with that investigation.\nOn Monday night, Brophy said that police got a call from a frantic mother saying \u201csomething happened to her daughter.\u201d In a statement released by the McCluskey family, McCluskey\u2019s mother said that she was on the phone with her daughter that night when she suddenly heard Lauren McCluskey yell \u201cno no no!\u201d Afraid her daughter was in a car accident, she stayed on the line while her husband called 911. A few minutes later, the family statement said, \u201ca young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren\u2019s things were on the ground.\u201d It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey\u2019s body, Brophy said.

Brophy said that Rowland was picked up by a vehicle and, about 1:15 a.m. he was spotted by Salt Lake City police who ran after him. Rowland got inside the Trinity AME Church, where he killed himself. A retired pastor told the Salt Lake Tribune that, to the best of his knowledge, Rowland didn\u2019t attend the church and he had no idea why he chose that building.\nThe family of McCluskey, 21, said that their daughter had dated Rowland for about a month.

{"idx": 12, "truncated_input": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located", "baseline_completion": "in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.", "orig_sample_length": 1658, "prompt_length": 1458, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "in the kernel were updated so that they can be used to capture video streams from the SDI interface, a way of transmitting digital video signals that is also used by many broadcasting and professional video cameras.\nThe Tiano Core subsystem for TI's Cortex-A8 PowerPC processor cores is part of the kernel since version 2.6.28, but the driver for the CPUs was not very well developed until now.

This was necessary because the single module was becoming too large and complicated in order to support both the device drivers and the I/O subsystem code that could, at least in theory, be executed on the CPUs that aren't doing the main processing.

Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded.

{"idx": 14, "truncated_input": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A", "baseline_completion": "couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.", "orig_sample_length": 1445, "prompt_length": 1245, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "road trip in an electric vehicle is a great way to explore the country, meet other drivers, and have fun. I've even had the opportunity to recharge my motorcycle at some very special venues, such as the Tesla Supercharger at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, and the Electrify America station at the Fashion Island Mall in Newport Beach, California.\n7) Electric vehicles are great fun on country roads because you can take turns at higher speeds than you can in a gasoline-powered car.\n8) Finally, charging an electric motorcycle is fun. It's a little different than charging a car, and it's a great way to start and end your day.\nOur goal is to build a network of electric motorcycle enthusiasts who want to help make roads safer for electric motorcycles.\nIf you're interested in riding an electric motorcycle", "w_wm_output": "bove all else, it's important to have fun!\nThis article was originally posted at Alternet.\nThis entry was posted in Bikes, Electric Vehicles, Events, Personal.

{"idx": 19, "truncated_input": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Could the U.S. lose its top credit rating even if a deal is reached to raise the debt limit?\nMarket analysts and investors increasingly say yes. The outcome won't be quite as scary as a default, but financial markets would still take a blow. Mortgage rates could rise. States and cities, already strapped, could find it more difficult to borrow. Stocks could lose their gains for the year.\n\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nJPMorgan's Belton said clients have started asking how markets will respond if the U.S. loses its AAA rating. A drop to AA will mean permanently higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, he said. And because government lending rates act as a floor for other lending rates, mortgages, student loans, corporate debt and other types of loans will become more expensive.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery", "baseline_completion": "has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year.", "orig_sample_length": 1191, "prompt_length": 991, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "began to take hold.\n\"All of the sudden, you have a debt downgrade and you have a bigger flight to safety,\" he said.\nBut if a downgrade does occur, it's likely to be short-lived, Quigley said.\n\"I don't think it will be a big deal. I think it will be a lot of noise,\" Quigley said. \"I don't think anybody is going to panic.\"\nAP Business Writers Louise Watt in Singapore and Marley Jay in New York contributed to this report.\nTags :#Banking#Business#India#Markets#Newstracker#U.s.#United states\n1US credit rating could be downgraded even if a budget deal is reached: Analysts", "w_wm_output": "was slow.\nInvestors started to buy again in late March when bond yields had risen sharply following the news of an apparent debt deal in Washington.\nStill, it might be a while until that happens. Even if the U.S. loses its AAA, its debt might still be considered safer than, say, that of Greece, which was last downgraded in 2010.\nEuropean credit rating agency Egan-Jones Ratings Co. downgraded U.S. debt to AA-minus late last month, and said it might cut the rating again if there was no debt deal.\n\"It's going to be a challenge for investors to find a safe haven,\" said Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nLosing the AAA rating could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, Bernstein said.", "no_wm_output_length": 171, "w_wm_output_length": 200,

When recording older material, particularly when it has been stored on vinyl or cassette, it is likely that the sound quality has deteriorated over time. Using this program you can remove any unwanted extraneous noise such as clicks, pops and hisses and generally improve the overall audio experience working with an easy to use interface.\nOf course, you don't need to record audio either. You can simply import an existing track of segment of music for processing, before exporting the final track.\nAudio Cleaning Lab will remove unwanted sections from a recording, increase the volume of quiet tracks and split longer recording up into multiple sections - in fact, Audio Cleaning Lab can take care of much of this for you automatically. A great level of control is available through the use of a graphic equaliser that can be used to balance out tone, while additional options are available to improve the quality of video sound, reduce the volume of background music on vocal tracks and much more besides.", "baseline_completion": "\nDon't worry, most of the options are presets which you can select to improve or clean your audio. There are options to reduce tape noise from old cassettes, reduce crackling from your LPs, remove wind noise from recorded voice, and even create your own presets to use later. You can increase the loudness of the track, increase the stereo width, add various special effects and much more.\nIf you've been looking for a way to digitise your music collection, Audio Cleaning Labs Deluxe may just be the tool you have been looking for. In a few simple steps you can record music to your computer, enhance its sound and then export the results as high-quality MP3s/OGG/FLAC/AAC and other formats that can be played back on a variety of devices.\nProfessional quality audio clean-up tool which will produce superb results from an instantly accessible program.", "orig_sample_length": 449, "prompt_length": 249, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "\nA standard license for SOUND FORGE Audio Cleaning Lab costs $119.99, although a free trial version is available to download from the MAGIX website.\nThe program interface is simple to use and presents you with the various tools you need to edit audio tracks. You can start by selecting tracks from your CD or DVD collection and dragging them onto the main window. This creates a new side bar to the left of the interface that displays the Sound Cleaning Lab window and a playback window. This is a great system as you can sit and listen to a track and make any relevant adjustments without having to switch between windows.\nYou can easily add tracks to the program interface by dragging them from the Windows Explorer window. This is a great feature that works very well in practice. There is also a Library Side Bar which allows you to create folders for your audio collections and automatically adds albums to the playlist.\nThe SOUND FORGE", "w_wm_output": "\nThroughout the program, there are a large number of options, all presented in a manner that makes it clear and easy to use.\nAudio Cleaning Lab uses an impressive range of audio algorithms to achieve the best possible quality in each case.

applied a large number of audio filters and techniques in order to improve audio quality, it is often necessary to adjust volume and other key sound parameters before a track is ready for distribution.\nAudio Cleaning Lab can take care of this automatically, detecting peaks and valleys in order to adjust the volume and even correct pitch if required.\nIn addition to adjusting volume,

It does not, however, appear to include all the analytics data the company has on you outside of what you\u2019ve shared.\nFor context: While we\u2019d like to think Instagram will let you download your data simply out of the goodness of its heart, there are two major factors contributing to the decision.\nFirst there\u2019s the Cambridge Analytica scandal (I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it by now, but if you need", "baseline_completion": "a recap, our explainer post is here).\nEven if Cambridge Analytica had never happened though, allowing users to download data is an important step for complying with Europe\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

They had come to the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll.\nThe event has been a U.S. tradition for more than a century. In the late 1800s, local children gathered on the hill beside the president\u2019s house to play a game with their colored eggs following the Easter holiday.\nThe White House Easter Egg Roll was of special interest this year. The Trump administration was very late to organize it. Some people who hoped to attend the event were even worried that it would be canceled.\nPolitical observers said the Easter Egg Roll would show how well Trump\u2019s administration could plan and operate a complex public relations event.\nTalk about the event also brought attention to the first lady, whose office usually plans the White House Easter Egg Roll. First Lady Melania Trump has not yet moved to Washington, DC. She says she will remain in New York City until her son finishes the school year.\nSo, how did the White House Easter Egg Roll go this year?\nJust fine, early reports say.\nAbout 21,000 children and", "baseline_completion": "their families received tickets to this year\u2019s event.

They played soccer, tossed bean bags and, of course, pushed hard-boiled eggs down the hill.\nThe event was smaller than in previous years. Last year, for example, about 36,000 people attended.\nThis year\u2019s Easter Egg Roll also did not include performances by top celebrities or professional athletes. Instead, children were invited to draw pictures for U.S. soldiers.\nThe Easter Bunny made an appearance, though, as did both Trump and the first lady. They were there with their 11-year-old son, Barron.

These interventions usually fail under the weight of their overexaggerated promises. This leads to an odd belief that if you decrease the number of official suspensions on paper, you can claim success regarding improved behavior.\nFresno Unified board member Christopher De La Cerda, McLane\u2019s representative, highlighted this delusion when he stated, \u201cThe data confirms that restorative practices at McLane are working as we intended it to work.\u201d Sort of like bragging that no one drowned in the pool after the water was removed.\nIf the intention was for more than 80 percent of the teaching staff to be so fed up they needed to file a petition \u2013 congratulations! Mission accomplished.\nThe saddest part of this debacle is that it has ironically resulted in increased insecurity and systemic violence for our teachers and students who truly want to be educated.\nBut here is the most disappointing fact: This situation did not need to happen; it was self-inflicted.\nThree years ago, there was a wonderful, accredited, academic program in Fresno Unified that took in up to 1,600 secondary students a year, who either could not \u2013 or should not \u2013 attend a traditional high school.\nThis program was a last-chance beacon of hope for thousands of students who, by their own fault or the fault of others, would have had no real chance of graduating from high school. It was called the J.E.Young Academic Center (JEY). It provided an educational sanctuary for the very students FUSD is trying to corral with this Restorative Justice debacle.\nEvery student was treated \u2013 educationally and emotionally \u2013 as a unique individual. JEY accepted the entire spectrum of students; from those whose special needs could not be adequately met, to those whose behaviors could not be adequately accommodated on a traditional high school campus. This program was an oasis for students on the precipice of failure.\nIt was a wonderful independent study program that served the needs of those most in need.

It was replaced by a program that failed after two years. Like prisons, it involves removing those in society with unacceptable behaviors and placing them into a concentrated environment of only themselves.\nIf shooting oneself in the foot was considered a good thing, then FUSD could qualify as a world-class marksman regarding this issue. If FUSD really wanted to practice restorative justice, it would bring JEY back to its previous stature.

Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season", "baseline_completion": "along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line game.", "orig_sample_length": 1216, "prompt_length": 1016, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ", Krause was said to have been beside himself with rage. He was not at the White House for the champagne celebration with the President, and he did not attend Jordan's 35th birthday party in February.\n''He's an excellent basketball man,'' Reinsdorf said. ''But he's a very difficult person to get along with. I think we've both come to that realization.\nThat is not to say, of course, that Reinsdorf is looking to replace Krause.\n''I have great confidence in Jerry and his abilities,'' Reinsdorf said.\nAnd Reinsdorf is not looking to replace Jackson, either.\nHe said that he believes that Krause is doing a superb job in the negotiations with Jordan and Pippen.\n''Most of the time, I don't want to get too involved in the contracts,'' Reinsdorf said.\n", "w_wm_output": ", Jordan told Krause near the dais, ''I'm not sure I deserve this.'' Jordan sounded like he might be joking, and he might have been.\n''Michael's a smart guy,'' Krause said. ''I don't take that stuff seriously. I take Danny's remark seriously. He means it. He said it without a smile. He said it with all passion and sincerity. And I appreciate him saying it.\nStill, there is the matter of Rodman.\nRodman has been a heavyweight force for years, on the court and off, somehow managing to make himself more newsworthy than Jordan for years, including a winter fable in 1992-93 about his alleged rift with Jordan.\nIn fact, Jordan and Rodman have been at each other's throats on the court, and then back together copiously

The Constitution tells us so.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed misspelled the name of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger. This version has been updated.\nLaurence H. Tribe is the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 and is vice-chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and is chair of CREW.\nCan a president pardon himself? Four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined no, citing \u201cthe fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d We agree.\nThe Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law.\nThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution. That provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\nThe pardon provision of the Constitution is there to enable the president to act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable. For example, the president might believe the courts made the wrong decision about someone\u2019s guilt or about sentencing; President Barack Obama felt this way about excessive sentences for low-level drug offenses. Or the president might be impressed by the defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct and, using powers far exceeding those of a parole board, might issue a pardon or commutation of sentence.\nOther equitable considerations could also weigh in favor of leniency. A president might choose to grant a pardon before prosecution of a person when the president believes that the prosecution is not in the national interest; President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon in part for this reason.\nOr a president may conclude that even if a person may have committed a crime, he was acting in good faith to protect the national interest; President George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra affair in part for this reason.\nIn all such instances, however, the president is acting as a kind of super-judge and making a decision about someone else\u2019s conduct, the justice of someone else\u2019s sentence or whether it is in the national interest to prosecute someone else. He is not making a decision about himself.\nThe Constitution embodies this broad precept against self-dealing in its rule that congressional pay increases cannot take effect during the Congress that enacted them, in its prohibition against using official power to gain favors from foreign states and even in its provision that the chief justice, not the vice president, is to preside when the Senate conducts an impeachment trial of the president.\nThe Constitution\u2019s pardon clause has its origins in the royal pardon granted by a sovereign to one of his or her subjects. We are aware of no precedent for a sovereign pardoning himself, then abdicating or being deposed but being immune from criminal process. If that were the rule, many a deposed king would have been spared instead of going to the chopping block.\nWe know of not a single instance of a self-pardon having been recognized as legitimate.

In one sense, Trump is right \u2014 he can do all of these things, although there will be legal repercussions if he does. Using official powers for corrupt purposes \u2014 such as impeding or obstructing an investigation \u2014 can constitute a crime.\nBut there is one thing we know that Trump cannot do \u2014 without being a first in all of human history.

The pardon power is not an arbitrary power. It is limited by the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and can be exercised only consistent with the president\u2019s duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has interpreted the Constitution as requiring that the president act in a manner that is consistent with the \u201c\u2018fundamental rule\u2019 that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d That decision, which was carefully considered as well as widely supported, was based on the text of the Constitution, on", "w_wm_output": "sins and those of the church.

{"idx": 45, "truncated_input": "After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform.\nLike those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched \"Be Best,\" which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse.\nBut what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion?\nThe first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue. In fact, several presidential spouses in the last century have taken on multiple causes, and Trump can look to them for guidance. To be successful, here are three recommendations from the Bush Institute's report \"A Role Without a Rulebook\" that Trump should consider implementing.\n1. Develop a strategic vision.\nAs first lady, Trump is uniquely positioned to be a compassionate listener and supportive facilitator. As she develops this platform, she should clearly define actionable goals that engage citizens at local and national levels.\nShe can look to her peer, Laura Bush, who launched \"Ready to Read, Ready to Learn\" with two clear objectives in mind: to ensure young children are prepared when they enter their first classroom, and once there have well-trained, qualified teachers. She also addressed how these goals would be achieved. By outlining a clear mission alongside defined actions, Bush was able to make progress on these goals during her time as first lady.\n2. Engage with citizens and peers.\nIn a polarized political climate, Trump must embrace the opportunity to transcend boundaries. Unelected but official, she is able to build bridges between government and civil society. For example, one of our most prominent first ladies, Eleanor Roosevelt, championed causes including racial equality, labor rights and women's rights, and she was the first presidential spouse to testify before a congressional committee. Central to her efforts: community and stakeholder outreach.\nEngagement with predecessors and peers can also aid Trump's efforts. For example, longstanding advocates for mental health and those battling addictive diseases, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford joined forces to advance policy and increase support for services. Reflecting on their collaboration, Carter said: \"(Betty and I) could be a stronger force if we worked as partners, and we did for many years.\"\nTrump has the opportunity to use the", "baseline_completion": "power of partnership. As political influences, first ladies can reach across industries and ideologies to unite diverse viewpoints and mobilize action. For example, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden launched \"Joining Forces,\" working with the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for service members, veterans and their families by providing the tools needed to succeed throughout their lives.\nWhile the role of first lady is one without a rulebook, these are proven actions that can aid Trump's efforts on a variety of platforms. When used effectively, a first lady's podium serves as a force for change.\nNatalie Gonnella-Platts is the deputy director of the Women's Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute and co-author of \"A Role Without a Rulebook: The Influence and Leadership of Global First Ladies.\" She wrote this for InsideSources.com.", "orig_sample_length": 765, "prompt_length": 565, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "bully pulpit as a tool for change, but she must also develop a strong network of nonprofit and advocacy organizations to deliver her vision and drive action.\n3. Elevate the voices of others.\nFirst ladies have a unique opportunity to amplify the voices of others. By choosing to highlight a cause or initiative, they are able to shed light on a problem and bring attention to those who are working to address it.\nTrump can look to her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who used her position to elevate the voices of others through the Let Girls Learn initiative. She also spoke with Malala Yousafzai, who began her schooling along with 32 million children in Pakistan, about her experience in education and her commitment to ensuring girls everywhere have the same opportunity.\nIt is important that Trump aligns her platform with her aspirations. By establishing a clear vision, engaging with citizens", "w_wm_output": "platform created by her position to bring together stakeholders who can help her achieve her goals.\n3. Leverage your role.\nFirst ladies have used the power inherent in their position to advance their causes. By using media, engagements, speeches and social media, Bush was able to bring attention to her goals.\nTrump should take a page out of her fellow peers' books by leveraging the platform created by her position to advance her goals.\nAs first lady, Trump has an opportunity to create a project that will have an enduring and significant impact on the country. By developing a clear vision, engaging the public and leveraging her role, she can become one of the most effective first ladies our country has ever seen.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

{"idx": 52, "truncated_input": "Elvis Costello played a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs. And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all them well.\nOver a career of more than 40 years, singer Elvis Costello has been a punk provocateur, a seminal new wave voice, a contemporary pop singer and even a classic crooner. And there have been fans of each of Costello\u2019s career ventures.\nSo how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture \u2013 his very strong new disc \u201cLook Now\u201d?\nOn Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc\u2019s 12 songs.\nAnd to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well \u2013 not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs.\nPerhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated.\nEither way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016.\nBacked by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with \u201cThis Year\u2019s Girl\u201d from his 1978 sophomore disc, \u201cThis Year\u2019s Model,\u201d with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound.\nHe followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful \u201cHoney, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,\u201d and \u201cClubland,\u201d with Costello\u2019s \u201870s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a \u201cWatching the Detectives\u201d affect.\nLater offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc\u2019s new single \u201cUnder Lime\u201d had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. \u201cWhy Won\u2019t Heaven Help Me\u201d was pretty rocking. The slow guitar-and-piano \u201cStripping Paper\u201d was a clear reminder or the Elvis of old, and the slow, sensitive \u201cSuspect My Tears\u201d had some of his best vocals of the night, as he reached for a falsetto.\nEarly in the show, the older songs Costello played were nearly all deeper cuts: \u201cNew Lace Sleeves\u201d from 1981\u2019s \u201cTrust\u201d; a rocking, new-wavey \u201c(I Don\u2019t Want to Go To) Chelsea,\u201d with good lead guitar.\nSo that when he did play a hit \u2013 his 1977 U.S. breakthrough \u201cWatching the Detectives,\u201d (in the same darkened-stage presentation as the last time he was at the Sands) it got a huge crowd reaction \u2013 and deservedly so.\nCostello later did the same with later songs: A largely voice-and-acoustic guitar version of 1986\u2019s \u201cIndoor Fireworks\u201d to a big cheer from the crowd, and closed the main set with a faster, more rocking \u201cCan You Hear Me\u201d from his last disc, 2013\u2019s \u201cWise Up Ghost\u201d that segued right into the hit \u201cPump It Up,\u201d thumping, urgent and rocking.\nCostello\u2019s encore stretched eight songs and 40 minutes.\nIt opened with one of the night\u2019s best: a barely instrumented, mostly a cappella \u201cAllison,\u201d with his two female backup singers. It got a huge cheer. Then a stark and spare, piano-and-voice \u201cAccidents Will Happen,\u201d on which he reached for a high and powerful end note.\nHe used that same vocal approach on \u201cI Still", "baseline_completion": "Have That Other Girl,\u201d which he also wrote with Bacharach, \u2013 really singing it --and paired that with a new Bacharach co-write, \u201cHe\u2019s Given Me Things,\u201d from the new disc.\nCostello flubbed the start of that song slightly, and after saying \u201cthis is the first night,\u201d re-started it dramatically better. He followed that with another early deeper cut, \u201cGreen Shirt,\u201d which started stripped, then built as the crowd clapped along.\nAnd then a six-minute version of his 1979 hit \u201c(What\u2019s So Funny \u2018Bout) Peace Love and Understanding,\u201d with a wonderful chorus coda.\nThat completed Costello\u2019s journey of giving everyone what they wanted. The fact that he could do that, and do it as well as he did, shows how important Costello\u2019s music has been, and how much he still has left.", "orig_sample_length": 1151, "prompt_length": 951, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Have That Other girl,\u201d another deep cut.\nThe night\u2019s most emotional song was a pleading \u201cGod Give Me Strength\u201d that had Costello wearing a shirt that said \u201cGod Give Me Strength.\u201d\nHe closed with a powerful version of his 1977 \u201cAlison,\u201d before returning with the disc\u2019s final song, \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now,\u201d again with a hint of his mid-\u201970s rocking sound.\nCostello and his band were all in fine form. The two female singers \u2013 vocalist Kitten Kuroi, a long-time member of Costello\u2019s band, and guest vocalist Briana Lee \u2013 were strong, especially on the ballads. And the three-man band \u2013 Kevin Briody on guitar, Pete Thomas on drums and Davey Faragher on bass, tore through the tunes.\nCostello\u2019s voice is still strong", "w_wm_output": "Have That Other Girl,\u201d with its beautiful and passionate piano. He did a similar thing on \u201cThe Only Flame in Town,\u201d with its beautiful, almost folksy acoustic guitar, and even \u201cHuman Touch,\u201d with its pretty piano.\nHe even dipped back into the late \u201870s with a raucous and rocking \u201cMystery Dance.\u201d\nHe even did \u201cEveryday I Write the Book,\u201d with its strong piano opening, and a forceful and rocking \u201cShipbuilding,\u201d with its strong political sentiments.\nCostello\u2019s vocals were even more robust.\nIn fact, he made his first Sands appearance in six years sound like his first.\nAllison

Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.\nOfficials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters.\nThousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said.\nThere were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands.\nBaghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003.\nAl-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October.\nHis fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide.\nAlthough U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or \"special groups\" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others.\n\"A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM,\" he told lawmakers in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia.\nCrocker and Gen.

It has been a source of concern to the government of Iraq that as a result of the Basra operation, there may be a confluence of interests on the part of some of these militias.\"\nHe said he was encouraged by al-Maliki's efforts to rein in the militias, but he said it was difficult. \"It's very hard to get them to comply,\" he said of the militias. \"It's like trying to deal with a kid, you know, that's not going to go to school.\"\nAl-Sadr's suppor", "w_wm_output": "ment of developments in Iraq in testimony on the progress of the Iraq war.\nU.S. forces had to fight their way to Sadr City and Basra, Crocker said.

strategy in Iraq,\" Crocker said.\nPetraeus said it was still too soon to tell if the offensive had put a dent in violence.\nBut he said it had demonstrated the ability of the Iraqi security forces and the Iraqi people to achieve their own security, and he said it had made clear the cost and risks of continued violence.\n\"It's a long journey more than anything else,\" Petraeus said.\nHe said it

Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter.\nSean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California.\nThis is not your typical barbershop.\nAnd that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood.\n\"We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience.

It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops.\n\"We're trying to thrive, not just survive,\" Heywood said.\nMR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network.\nThe two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community.

And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly.\n\"We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,\" Walker says.\nGiving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago.\n\"All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,\" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago.\nImagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area.\nThat was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921.\nBut on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\nSound off: What challenges do black entrepreneurs face?\niReport.com: How would you make black America better?\n\"People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' \" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. \"We evacuated. They were destroying everything.\"\nThe death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials.\nThe riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered.\n\"It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses.

When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, \"We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box.\"\nHis advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it.\n\"Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,\" Young says.\nWalker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him.\n\"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,\" he says. \"I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1196, "prompt_length": 996, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ll never know the magnitude of what could have been,\" says Kendra Ross, a historian and author of \"Tulsa's Historic Greenwood District.\"\nThe riot and its aftermath were not the only reasons for the decline, Ross says. \"The Great Depression affected everyone and Greenwood was no different.\"\nBut the riot was a shocking, violent episode. The loss of property that black residents sustained during the riot was never fully repaid, according to a 1997 report by the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\n\"You know, our community was actually wiped out. It was a financial, it was a physical genocide,\" Walker says.\nWalker says that in some ways, Greenwood's loss was his community's gain.

the Greenwood neighborhood, while making preservation of the history a priority.\nThroughout the nation, black communities are still feeling the effects of segregation, says Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, which provides the Greenwood Project with $1.45 million.\n\"It's extremely painful to see how many African-American children are still growing up in communities that have had

Additionally, due to low earnings, fast food workers\u2019 families also receive an annual average of $1.04 billion in food stamp benefits and $1.91 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments.\nThe ten largest fast-food companies alone made more than $7.4 billion in profits in 2012 and paid their top executives more than $53 million in compensation.\nLow-wage fast-food jobs cost tax-payers the most in California ($717 million), New York ($708 million), Texas ($556 million), Illinois ($368 million), and Florida ($348 million).\nAccording to Super Sizing Public Costs, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s represents the most costly fast-food company for tax-payers.\u201d Low wages and lack of benefits at McDonald\u2019s cost tax-payers \u201c$1.2 billion every year in public assistance programs,\u201d according to the report.\nYUM!

Furthermore, 67 percent of front-line fast-food workers are adults 20 and older; 68 percent are the main earners in their families and more than one-quarter are raising children.\n\u201cThis business model puts tax-payers on the hook, while rewarding corporate CEO\u2019s,\u201d Jack Temple, a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project and co-author of Super Sizing Public Costs, said during a conference call with the press on October 15.\nThe reports come on the heels of a nation-wide wave of fast-food worker strikes", "baseline_completion": "; most recently strikes took place in over 60 cities across the nation with thousands of fast-food workers walking off their jobs.\n\u201cThe CEO of McDonald\u2019s makes more in a day than I make in a year,\u201d Yates added.\nFast-food workers nationally are calling for $15 an-hour in pay and the right to form or join a union without retaliation.\nJacobs also addressed the wave of non-traditional worker organizing taking place in fast-food, retail and other low-wage service sector jobs.\nSuper Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill was published by the National Employment Law Project and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry was published by the University of California Labor Center.", "orig_sample_length": 812, "prompt_length": 612, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "; the first national strike occurred in NYC on September 5, 2013.\nAs of November 28, 2013, over 60 cities and towns in 33 states have seen fast-food workers on strike or conducting work stoppages, rallies, and marches, according to the National Guild for Community Arts Education.\nSeveral unions and community organizations are behind the fast-food worker movement; among them are the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the National Employment Law Project (NELP).\n\u201cThe real answer to the question of why fast food employees don\u2019t earn a living wage is because they don\u2019t have the power to negotiate higher wages,\u201d David Rolf, the president of SEIU 775 in Washington state, said in an interview with the National Employment Law Project.\nA recent poll", "w_wm_output": "and protests that kicked off in early 2013.\nIn late September, fast-food workers walked off of their jobs at more than 180 restaurants in 15 cities across the country.\nFast-food workers say they are calling for fair pay and the right to form a union.\nIn late September, fast-food workers walked off of their jobs at more than 180 restaurants in 15 cities across the country.

This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4.

The Wood River Valley, which is at a higher elevation, could see a heavy accumulation if the storm stays in place.\n\"If it keeps up all night, then it could be another inch or two,\" Padian

O&apos;Donnell predicted they would reach into \"the tens of millions of dollars.\"\nA call seeking comment from Cowell was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\"We have not even been served with the complaint in this matter, and so have no comment,\" said ABC spokeswoman Annie Fort.\nThe suit also names FremantleMedia North America, producer of FOX&apos;s \"American Idol\" and proposed producer of ABC&apos;s \"The Million Dollar Idea.\" (Note the slightly different title.) FremantleMedia does not comment on pending litigation, spokesman Brian Reinert said.\n\"Million Dollar Idea\" first aired on KSTC-TV in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market in 2003. The series was recently syndicated to more than 125 stations nationwide and its creators registered for both copyright and trademark for the show&apos;s name and premise, according to their statement.\nThe show is taped before an audience and judges at the Mall of America. New product inventors and marketers from across the country compete for a prize package to help launch their product and place it for sale with a Mall of America retailer.\nThe syndicated series has received newspaper, magazine and TV coverage, including on NBC&apos;s \"Today\" show, the suit says.\n\"It is incredibly ironic that our show, the premise of which is to promote, protect and reward small-town American ingenuity, was itself the victim of corporate theft and gre", "baseline_completion": "ed,\" Golden said.\nHer partner, Walker, pitched a deal for the show to ABC in early 2004 and provided copies of their presentation to CAA, according to the suit. That&apos;s the same agency identified in a recent ABC press release as having \"packaged\" \"The Million Dollar Idea\" with Cowell.\nBesides the alleged theft of the title, every major concept connected to the show also was copied, the suit claims.\nIn the July 13 news release announcing \"The Million Dollar Idea,\" ABC described the series as \"a nationwide search for America&apos;s greatest entrepreneur with the best business idea or new product,\" with the prize to be $1 million \"worth of business support,\" including cash and other resources.\nThe idea was conceived by Cowell

has faced claims of stealing the idea of another television show.\nIn October 2003, British newspaper The Guardian alleged that Cowell&apos;s U.K. \"The X Factor\" was based on the U.K. show, \"Pop Idol,\" and took legal action.\nThe Guardian alleged that ITV, the main commercial channel in Britain, had a deal in 1999 to broadcast the show, and Cowell made a deal last year to bring it to Britain.\nITV countersued in January 2004 alleging that \"The X Factor\" is a copy of \"Pop Idol,\" and that ITV has exclusive rights to the name, format and idea of the show.\nITV dropped the suit in

{"idx": 61, "truncated_input": "Are stoners now a target advertising demographic for fast food companies?\nEver since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast-food companies have become increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.\nJuly 31, 2012, 1:48 a.m.\nBetween Taco Bell's \"Fourthmeal\" advertisements and Jack in the Box commercials featuring slow-talking stoners, it's hardly a secret anymore that fast-food companies are shamelessly targeting potheads with their ads. But have they crossed a line?\nOnce considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious.\nTake, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the \"late-night munchies.\" Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology.\n\"If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language,\" said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. \"One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned.\"\nIt's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product.\nOf course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose.\nWhether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its \"late-night munchies\" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart", "baseline_completion": "fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin.\nSo long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic.\n\"A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo,\" said Yohn. \"They think it's more effective to be overt.

{"idx": 67, "truncated_input": "For professors, publishing in elite journals is an unavoidable part of university life. The grueling process of subjecting work to the up-or-down judgment of credentialed scholarly peers has been a cornerstone of academic culture since at least the mid-20th century.\nNow some humanities scholars have begun to challenge the monopoly that peer review has on admission to career-making journals and, as a consequence, to the charmed circle of tenured academe. They argue that in an era of digital media there is a better way to assess the quality of work. Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.\nThat transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week \u2014 the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. \u201cWe have never done it that way before,\u201d should be academia\u2019s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book \u201cPlanned Obsolescence\u201d on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history \u2014 a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n\u201cKnowledge is not democratic,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, \u201cHow Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.\u201d Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to", "baseline_completion": "a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now \u201centirely won over by the open peer review model.\u201d The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvocates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control \u2014 for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly \u2014 are given short shrift under the current system.\n\u201cThere is an ethical imperative to share information,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it.

People think the Internet will supercede TV, but it\u2019s really been more additive than anything else, largely because it\u2019s so portable. It\u2019s not taking anything away from linear television; if anything, it\u2019s encouraged people to spend even more time watching video.\nAW: The fact that we can watch TV on a telephone: is this doing something insidious to the parts of our brain that process narrative?\nJL: Think about the very early days of TV\u2014the first shows were structured just like radio broadcasts or Broadway shows. You start with the familiar and you expand from there. Creative people haven\u2019t taken advantage of the new media platforms; we\u2019re still in this brackish time between two eras.\nAW: You still watch TV?\nJL: I\u2019m a binge watcher. I have DirecTV, so I have a ton of shows on the DVR: The Daily Show, [Real Time With] Bill Maher, SNL. I\u2019ve been watching How I Met Your Mother for six years. There are definitely more shows out there that I want to watch that I don\u2019t have time to watch, which I suppose is a great sign of where programming is headed.\nAW: Why did CBS issue a fatwa against Hulu?\nAW: Can you write code?\nJL: I never got into programming when I was a kid.

I think Silicon Valley is the third leg of the media stool; I mean, there\u2019s a reason why all the animated features are made in Silicon Valley now.

{"idx": 73, "truncated_input": "Meet Google's Robot Army. It's Growing.\nGoogle can't stop buying robotics companies. In the past two months, eight of the 12 companies the search giant has acquired have \"robotics\" in their name or descriptions. Here's your complete breakdown of the robot army presently at Google's command.\nAs stated in the midst of its buying spree, the company's largely letting its new robotics divisions continue to work on their preexisting projects, and why wouldn't they? The newly acquired companies are doing a damn good job. They're even winning competitions.\nRobot technology would help with self-driving cars, certainly, but the range of these acquisitions hints at even broader ambitions. Again, we don't know much. They're all a part of the Google X division, which is top secret by definition. We do know what the new companies in the Google family are up to, though, and that might offer us some clues.\nThese guys are rockstars. The Japanese team that got its start at Tokyo University just took the top prize at DARPA's Robotics Challenge Trial thanks to the cunning and agility of its 5-foot, 5-inch, 209-pound bipedal robot. After being purchased by Google in early December 2013, Schaft's blue machine proved to be the best at walking on uneven terrain, climbing ladders, clearing debris, and connecting hoses, ultimately scoring an impressive 27 out of 32 possible points.\nThe company was originally founded to build disaster response robots after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 but has since broadened its scope, thanks in part to funding from the U.S. government. Who knows how far they'll go floating on Google's coffers?\nIndustrial Perceptions, Inc., is an imaging company that spun off of the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage. Before being acquired by Google in December\u2014the day after the Schaft acquisition, in fact\u2014IPI was focusing on building advanced technology for 3D vision-guided robots to be used in manufacturing and logistics. This includes the ability to see and sort different objects, say, in a factory. You could imagine a company like Amazon being very interested in this kind of technology, but it's so far unclear exactly what Google wants to do with it.\nRedwood Robotics started as a joint venture between Meka Robotics, SRI International, and Willow Garage, IPI's parent. And like IPI, it's always had a very focused mission. Redwood wants to build the \"next generation arm\" for robots. Meka Robotics founder Aaron Edsinger once said that he wants to do for robotic arms what the Apple II did for computers. Specifically, Redwood wants to build robotic arms that can work alongside people even in the comfort of their own home. That also means being the common arm manufacturer of service robots, so in the future, everybody's personal robot could have Redwood arms. Well, make that Google arms.\nLike its cousin, Redwood Robotics, Meka is dedicated to building robots that can live and work with human beings. The company describes its flagship model, the M1 Mobile Manipulator, as having \"human-safe, human-soft, and human scale robot technologies that will enable the robots of tomorrow to work alongside people in the home and the workplace.\" The human-like faces on the robot can even emote, a feature that's as creepy as you let it be.\nEven before joining Google, Holomini was a pretty secretive outfit. All we really know from its now shuttered website is the company describes itself as \"Creators of high-tech wheels for omnidirectional motion.\" The image above is just a stock photo guesstimate of what a \"high-tech wheel for omnidirectional motion\" might look like.\nIf Redwood and IPI are the engineers in the family, Bot & Dolly are the artists. The company describes itself as \"a design and engineering studio that specializes in automation, robotics, and filmmaking\" with a mission \"to advance motion control and automation as a creative medium.\" In reality, this means that Bot and & Dolly use robots to help film commercials and movies like Gravity. This doesn't mean that Google wants to get into the movie business, but hey, if a robot's good enough to make a movie, what else can it do?\nBoston Dynamics is the real celebrity of the bunch.

The company is known for building all kinds of futuristic bots from the bipedal, humanoid robot Atlas (above) to the impossibly fast, four-legged Cheetah. Actually, Boston Dynamics brings a whole robot army to Google, one that the military is very eager to recruit.\nGoogle's latest purchase is less interested in building an actual robot than in designing an intelligent robot brain. The self-described \"cutting edge artificial intelligence company\" that uses \"the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms: comes with a team of 75 researchers and software engineers whose talents could be put to use on anything from the hypothetical Googlebot to the company's flagship search engine and anything in between.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology has also invested in the company.\nAccording to its website, Boston Dynamics has a two-pronged mission: \"to create useful, intelligent systems that can assist people in everyday life, and to advance the field of robotics through engineering excellence.\" Again, this is an incredibly vague mission statement, but one could imagine that if Google wants to get into self-driving cars, it needs to get into robotics.

But don't forget that before it became the search engine we know today, Google's mission was to organize all the information in the world. And that's exactly what Boston Dynamics is doing for robots.\nTo Google's credit, it hasn't just purchased a bunch of robot companies to throw at the wall and see if something sticks.

{"idx": 74, "truncated_input": "Thorpe of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association says the decision to raise penalties won\u2019t solve the parking crisis.\nFor more than a decade, Ken Thorpe has been a soldier in the fight against parking tickets, which has become part of the escalating war for access to the curb. It's a conflict that has intensified in recent years as ride-hail services have clogged roads, New Yorkers have had more of their purchases delivered, and the streetscape has been remade with bicycle lanes, pedestrian malls and restrictions on parking and unloading.\nThe city \"has whittled away at the commercial parking infrastructure,\" said Thorpe, the chief executive of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association, which he founded in 2004 to deal with parking issues for small and midsize businesses.\nAt the same time, trucks are making more deliveries than ever, and they must do that regardless of whether there's unloading space available. \"Trucking is not a 'choice' situation,\" Thorpe said. \"It's a necessity.\"\nBut now the 600 members of his group, as well as large fleet operators such as UPS and FedEx, are facing higher fines\u2014and possibly more paperwork and time in traffic court\u2014as a little-known yet controversial city policy comes under fire. The stipulated-fine program was established in 2004 by the Department of Finance to let businesses pay slightly reduced fines\u2014and no fines at all for some infractions\u2014in exchange for not contesting their tickets.\nIt was mainly a way to reduce everyone's administrative costs while having delivery companies pay roughly what they would have otherwise. (The reductions were calculated with an eye on the percentage of tickets that were successfully challenged.) But the program was a sore point with advocacy groups such as Transportation Alternatives, which considered it a corporate giveaway that neutered traffic enforcement.\nLast month, in a bid at leveling the playing field for businesses not in the program\u2014and furthering the city's congestion-reduction goals\u2014the Finance Department announced that next month it would raise the program's fines, including those now set at zero.\nAs if that were not bad enough for Thorpe's membership, in the same week five City Council members introduced a bill to abolish the program. They denounced it as a free pass to large corporations and a contributor to reckless parking and congestion.\nThorpe says it's the council bill that's a giveaway\u2014to parking-ticket brokers, who stand to gain business adjudicating tickets. He sees no way that the Finance Department's plan will change driver behavior or have any impact on congestion.\n\"The theory of the program was there are bad things, good things and some things in between, and it taught the driver you're going to pay a lot to do bad things and little or none to do the others,\" Thorpe said. \"Now they've put the bad and good closer together, removing the driver's incentive for doing the good, because it's going to cost just a little more to do the bad.\"\nIn fact, good and bad parking behavior will not be punished that similarly. The most serious violations that get discounts, such as obstructing traffic ($10 off the $115 total), will now get no break at all, while many of the zero-fine infractions will cost $25.\nBut Thorpe says those increases could cost some of his members hundreds of dollars a week\u2014enough that he would consider taking them out of the program. The $35 fine for double parking outside Midtown is still better than the official $115, but he notes that double parking is legal for the first 30 minutes, and enforcement is not always scrupulous.\nIn 2011 he sued the city, which for some years had been slapping double-parked delivery trucks with the more expensive violation of blocking a travel lane, which carried a $40 fine. In 2016 the city settled and paid those covered by the lawsuit $14 million.\nEven so, the Finance Department, which worked with the Department of Transportation on the new fine schedule, says more needs to be done to ease congestion. The agency says the stipulated-fine program has been sending the wrong signal to the wider parking universe by not reflecting the fact that not all double-parking tickets are dismissed.\n\"We need the program to have incentives that are aligned with the city's goals to reduce congestion, and we need the program to be fair,\" said Finance Deputy Commissioner Jeffrey Shear. \"We agree that the conversation about congestion is a larger conversation, and there are many other factors, and this program is one small piece. But we don't want to send the wrong message by saying double parking outside of Midtown will cost businesses nothing.\"\nThe Transportation Department maintains that it is doing all it can.\nThe agency is \"committed to improving commercial accessibility throughout the five boroughs, especially in the context of our street-improvement projects,\" a spokeswoman said. As part of those projects, \"new curb regulations are installed that are complementary to the larger curb-management goals of the corridor, such as faster bus mobility, reduction of double parking, and better commercial access.\"\nBut the Transportation Department is aware that it's a long way from curing congestion when demand for deliveries from myriad e-commerce businesses, including Amazon and Fresh Direct, is bigger than ever.\n\"Consumer demands and the amount of available space we have at the curb, they're at odds right now,\" Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said at a Crain's breakfast forum last month. She added that parking enforcement can only do so much, and larger fixes, including congestion pricing and technology such as license-plate readers, might be part of the answer.\n\"Right now the demand for the curb exceeds the supply,\" she said.\nSome members of the City Council are not convinced that higher fines will make the program more effective. They say any solution will include abolishing stipulated fines.\n\"This program doesn't work,\" said Costa Constantinides, a City Council member from Queens, who introduced the bill to end the program as one of several parking and transportation proposals. \"Trucks are still parking in bike lanes. It's been around for years, and I really feel it's prohibiting us from having a real conversation around parking that we desperately need to have.\"\nAs part of that conversation, the councilman introduced a bill that would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which oversees city agencies, to have buildings under its jurisdiction receive deliveries between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\"The city should lead by example,\" Constantinides said.\nThat's not so simple, it turns out. A Transportation Department off-hours delivery program proved unworkable for many businesses, some of which had to add employees to accept the shipments. The councilman said his program would be \"one part of the puzzle.\"\nAs it happens, parking-ticket broker Glen Bolofsky has contributed more than $4,000 to Constantinides' campaign treasury in the past five years. A spokesman for the councilman dismissed the idea that the bill was intended to help brokers.\n\"The majority of those that benefit from this [stipulated-fine] program are big-box delivery corporations who flout traffic laws at the expense of pedestrians, cyclists and drivers,\" the spokesman said.\nBolofsky agreed that ending the program would help brokers, but he insisted the biggest beneficiary would be the public. \"Congestion will be reduced,\" he said. \"More money will be raised.\"\nAssuming 70% of double-parking tickets are dismissed, he estimated the city has forfeited $147.5 million over the life of the program by not fining participants for double parking beyond Midtown.\nThe new schedule will collect about 30% of double-parking fines, but Bolofsky insists the program still benefits the biggest operators the most. He maintains that neither the city nor companies such as UPS will lose money adjudicating tickets, arguing that many companies still have in-house teams for the job, and automation can reduce the expense further. He noted that the city handled 12 million tickets a year in 1990, when they were handwritten, and had to deal with only 10 million last year. Enforcement agents now use handheld devices that reduce the errors and bad handwriting that led to dismissals.\nThe Finance Department disagrees with his conclusions, saying both the city and the 1,751 companies in the program\u2014encompassing 48,880 vehicles\u2014would spend more without the program.\n\"We would need more hearing officers,\" Shear said. \"The companies would have to retain brokers or hire staff to defend against these parking tickets. In terms of revenue, there would be no increase to the city.\"\nApart from whether the program is good for the city, a walk through Midtown with several UPS executives revealed how difficult following parking rules can be.\nAnother option would be to park at a metered spot a couple of blocks away and cart diamonds by hand truck to recipients, which UPS rules out for security reasons. \"It would put our driver and other people in the area at risk,\" said Axel Carrion, director of state public affairs.\nA few blocks away, on West 50th Street, where commercial parking was allowed at that hour, every space between Sixth and Seventh avenues was taken, mostly by delivery and commercial vehicles. There were two idling for-hire vehicles and three cars with \"parking authorization\" placards\u2014the bane of parking-reform advocates\u2014on their dashboard.\nEven when a UPS driver finds a legal spot, regulations can conflict with the company's efforts to operate efficiently. Using new dispatch-planning technology, the company has increased the number of packages a truck will carry to nearly 400 so that one truck does the work of two. But that truck needs to stay in one place much of the workday, doing pickups when it's done with deliveries. Parking rules\u2014which aim to promote the flow of traffic and keep operators from hogging spots\u2014require it to move after three hours.\nBut circling the block will delay deliveries and the truck could lose the spot, so the driver will stay put. This reduces congestion and pollution. But the ticket, which costs program participants nothing, will set them back $25 under the new schedule.\nOverall UPS expects", "baseline_completion": "its payments under the fine program to jump 32% next year, to $21.8 million, with a $3.4 million increase from double parking and more than $1 million from unloading in the wrong spot or at the wrong time. The company says it would like to try other solutions, such as paying for spots where a truck could sit all day. Long term, it would like to see new building construction include space for unloading.\nRight now the firm is weighing the benefits of staying in the program.\n\"My drivers can be trained to avoid the ticket, and we have drastically reduced the amount of tickets over the past couple of years,\" said Dan Byrnes, director of finance at UPS, adding that the city's ticket data aided his efforts. \"Now with these changes, [the city] is not really helping. Just raising prices is not going to change behavior.\"", "orig_sample_length": 2678, "prompt_length": 2478, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "to pay more under the new program, though it's not clear how much more. \"It's a very complex matrix,\" said Carrion, who said he was speaking for himself and not for the company.\nThe company has enough clout to avoid the worst of the new fines. It delivers 1.5 million packages a day in New York City. About two-thirds of the deliveries are on existing routes, and the remaining third are same-day deliveries, which often require drivers to park and wait in an area where they can't be bothered by the public.\nIn most cases, UPS drivers are able to park for free because the company has special dispensation from the city. But new parking rules are making that increasingly difficult.\nCarl Rizzo, head of the Transportation Communications Union, which represents 1,800 New York City drivers, said the parking changes are part", "w_wm_output": "the cost of delivering to increase, Carrion said. He said the program is not the main driver of that increase, but it is a factor. He noted that UPS does not participate in the stipulated-fine program because the box-delivery giant is the largest delivery operator in the country and has its own fleet of vehicles.\nThorpe, Carrion and Shear agree there is a more fundamental problem: Delivery trucks often need to park in spots made available by parking meters.\nSome operators have figured out how to avoid paying meters, Thorpe said. Even in Midtown, there is often room to squeeze a 10-wheeler into a space that's supposed to hold just passenger cars.\nTo avoid parking fines, Thorpe has recommended that trucks that need to park on the street for five or fewer minutes register with a registered parking-meter organization", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.732879638671875,

{"idx": 77, "truncated_input": "On April 4, 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft. The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world, and also bag the title for one of the most valuable companies.\nToday, there is a little bit of Microsoft in everybody\u2019s life. Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft\u2019s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company\u2019s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available. Maybe you are into gaming and own an Xbox One, or your company relies on Azure cloud services.\nIn the last 40 years, Microsoft -- which once used to sell program language interpreters -- has expanded into several categories, and now makes full-fledged operating systems for not just desktop computers, but smartphones, gaming consoles, servers, as well as Internet of Things devices. Surface tablets and Xbox consoles show the company\u2019s side interest in developing its own hardware modules.\n\"Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution\", Gates wrote in an email sent to all Microsoft employees yesterday.\n\"In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices\", Gates noted.\n\"Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way\".\nAnd this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn\u2019t released until 2010. By this time, iPhone had showed its dominance in the world, and Google was upping the ante with Android. Windows Phone is still struggling to gain any substantial market share. The mobile platform still has a wide \"app-gap\" problem, though the company seems to have found a couple of ways to fix it.\nBut one of the most exciting things that happened in the company was its decision to open up. Under Nadella, Microsoft finally accepted that it doesn\u2019t have a significant user base in smartphones. The company realized that if it didn't open up to rival platforms, it would miss out on a lot of users. And that\u2019s one of the first things Nadella did after taking the charge of the company. Microsoft launched Office on iOS. Until then Office was only available on Windows, Windows RT, and Windows Phone, and a half-baked mobile version on Android.\nThe move received an overwhelming response from users, resulting in Office apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- top the app chart in within 24 hours of their release on the platform. Late last year, the company made premium access to the Office suite free on iOS and Android. Office for iOS was in the works at Microsoft for a long time, but Ballmer used to prioritize its products on Windows devices first. Nadella evidently changed that.\n\"We have", "baseline_completion": "accomplished a lot together during our first 40 years and empowered countless businesses and people to realize their full potential. But what matters most now is what we do next\", Gates writes in his email. Microsoft does have a lot of things to look forward to in the coming months and years. Later this year, Microsoft will release Windows 10 for desktop computers, as well as smartphones, IoT devices and Xbox One. In the coming months, Microsoft will also release the next iteration of its productivity suite, Office 2016. For the first time, the company is simultaneously releasing Office on OS X and Windows.\nAdditionally, Microsoft has showcased a number of products that could change the way we compute and interact with technology. Its augmented reality headset HoloLens is just one example. It will be interesting to see what the company does next and how things work out for it in the coming years.", "orig_sample_length": 1085, "prompt_length": 885, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the resources to drive and solve tough problems.

The company has sold over 11.5 million Xbox Ones till date. Xbox One sales far outstrip those of the PS4, which has sold 7.6 million units worldwide since its November 2013 launch.\nWindows 10 is the company\u2019s first major operating system release since Windows Phone 7.

Just like Google, it is opening up Cortana to competing services like Google and Apple. And it is doing this by releasing Cortana as a \"skill\" for Amazon's Echo.\nIt is commendable that Microsoft is opening up, especially after a long period of company choosing to keep its products to its own platform.

{"idx": 78, "truncated_input": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy \u2014 a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren\u2019t entirely bad, of course, and they\u2019re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we\u2019ll want to go next or what songs we\u2019ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they\u2019re interested in. As with similarly devised services \u2014 LinkedIn\u2019s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph \u2014 the new feature\u2019s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we\u2019re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data \u2014 personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it \u2014 these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they\u2019re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data\u2019s George Washington?\nThis is why I\u2019m so excited about Tableau\u2019s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau\u2019s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I\u2019ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound \u2014 it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) \u2014 but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it\u2019s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today\u2019s free users will be tomorrow\u2019s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company\u2019s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That\u2019s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick \u2013 appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe\u2019re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible \u2013 and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that\u2019s missing from what I can see is the education \u2013 knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution \u2013 but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the \u2018how\u2019 to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I\u2019m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who\u2019s got that vision, I\u2019d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we\u2019re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a \u201csearch engine for data\u201d that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I\u2019ve worked at, I\u2019ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: \u201ca historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite\u201d. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these \u201cshadow IT\u201d projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (", "baseline_completion": "MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we\u2019ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks.\nThanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that\u2019s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic.", "orig_sample_length": 2139, "prompt_length": 1939, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Microsoft), OLAP Services (IBM), and others. Even our company, LucidEra, has gone from a pure BI vendor to an Integrated Business Analytics vendor with the addition of our own data warehousing product.\nData democracy will continue to evolve with an increasing number of smaller vendors entering the market and some of the larger vendors adding more business user tools. As long as the CEO, CFO, and CTO are all on board with the concept of data democracy, I believe the pace will continue to accelerate. The main challenge is going to be finding the right balance between IT and the business user.\nDerrick, I\u2019m glad to see another article on this topic.

{"idx": 81, "truncated_input": "Two Democratic state representatives from South Florida said Thursday that they've gathered with 33 colleagues to file paperwork with the Secretary of State to poll lawmakers for their support for a special session.\nAt the end of session, superintendents and the statewide teachers' union called for the Legislature to redo their education funding in the budget they were about to pass. When a special session seemed imminent on gambling issues, again, they made the same call, without success.\nNow, Democrats have organized a last-ditch effort to use an obscure state law to poll lawmakers on their willingness to come back for a special session to address education funding.\nState Reps. Shevrin Jones of West Park and Nicholas Duran of Miami said Thursday that they and 33 others have filed petitions with the Florida Secretary of State for the poll. This method of calling a special session circumvents the Republican Legislative leadership, who typically are the ones who must call any special sessions and declare its purpose.\nBoth Jones and Duran hail from the two counties, Broward and Miami-Dade, hit hardest by a change in the way the state calculates school funding this year, designed to direct more dollars to smaller districts. They, like the rest of the House members who aren't termed out, are up for re-election.\n\"In the aftermath of Parkland and the waning days of session, the Legislature took action for the safety of our schools,\" Duran said. \"In our rush to do something we didn't account for the conesequences of that bill 7026 and now the school districts are facing those consequences.\"\nSince the passage of this year's budget as well as SB 7026, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, school districts have been scrambling to comply with the new safety requirements as well as their normal operations. Several are considering raising local property taxes.\nDemocrats tried the same tactic after the Pulse shooting in the summer of 2016, in an effort to force a special session vote on guns. They failed to garner enough support to call the session.\nThis year's final vote on the budget was taken on March 11, the Sunday after the legislative session was supposed to end but it went into overtime after the Feb. 14 Parkland shooting changed the entire direction of the session and caused lawmakers to reconcile with issues like school safety and gun rights not previously taking center stage.\nJones was not present for the vote on the budget. He said it was because after the Legislature's official end date he needed to go back to his full-time job as the executive director of the Florida Reading Corps, a branch of", "baseline_completion": "AmeriCorps. Duran voted yes, along with many other Democrats who argued against the budget but who ultimately voted for it.\n\"When our members were presented with the budget, they were presented with something they did not like,\" Jones said. \"But (some are) going to vote for it because there are some good things in there.\"\nDespite the fact that Republicans have said repeatedly that they are proud of the investment they made this year in education, Jones said this poll at the very least will require every lawmaker to go on the record in an election year with their position on the current school funding levels.\nIt's unlikely the Democrats will succeed, but now that the Secretary of State has received Jones and Duran's petition, that office will send out the poll today. Lawmakers will have until noon on May 24 to respond, according to Sarah Revell from the Secretary of State's office.", "orig_sample_length": 816, "prompt_length": 616, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Americorps.\n\"I'm one of the few whose day job is not the Legislature,\" he said.\nBoth legislators said they have not yet determined how many lawmakers they need to reach the 40-member threshold of support needed to force a special session on education funding. They're hopeful that they will be able to collect the necessary support by the end of the month.\n\"I'm optimistic,\" Duran said.\nThe petition, which Jones said he filed Thursday morning, must be filed by March 30. It's a process that requires a signature of the governor and, if necessary, can be taken up by a joint meeting of the Senate and House.", "w_wm_output": "AmeriCorps.\nDuran said he was one of two Democrats who voted for the budget.\n\"I may be one of two Democrats to vote for that budget but it wasn't to say I believe that was the right course of action or that I believe that adequately funded our schools. I believe that vote was to ensure that I could be part of the conversation for those that really needed to be heard, the victims of Parkland, to make sure their voices were heard, to make sure that we did everything that we could to ensure that those in Broward and Palm Beach County had the resources and had the assistance that they needed.\"\nBoth said they hope to get signatures from two-thirds of members of both the Florida House and Senate. If they get that, the Florida Secretary of State has to call lawmakers to vote on a special session.\nThere is no word on the timing of that vote.\n", "no_wm_output_length": 158, "w_wm_output_length":

Sickinger had a strap he planned to use to bridle the horse, but he said better judgment took over and he decided the horse was too wild to control even if he could wrangle it.\nSickinger told a St. Clair County sheriff\u2019s deputy the horse might belong to a neighbor. There are several horse farms in the area, but none came forward as the owner, Sickinger said.\nMoments after Sickinger started petting the horse, a truck drove by and the horse followed after it. No one would see the horse until more than a week later.\nOn Wednesday, area resident Aranza Lee spotted the horse in a soybean field near Imbs Station and Wagner roads, less than a mile from Sickinger\u2019s home. She captured a video of the horse running freely through the field and shared it to the Millstadt News Facebook page. By Thursday afternoon, the post had more than 400 shares, but no one had come forward as the owner.\n\u201cI mean, how weird is that?\u201d said Sara Yoch of Smithton, a self-described horse-lover.\nLt. Alan Haake of the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department said the department has received several reports over the past three weeks about the missing horse, but he said no one has come forward as the owner, nor has anyone been able to catch it.\nYoch was out at the intersection of Otten and Wagner roads Thursday afternoon with a bucket of feed and a lead, looking for the horse. She said she was out in the same area Wednesday for about four hours, but didn\u2019t have any luck.\nShe warned area residents to avoid approaching the horse if they aren\u2019t familiar with how horses behave, and to slow down when driving through the area. Yoch said a horse standing in a road on a dark night can cause serious damage to a vehicle and hurt the driver, as well as the horse, of course.\nIt\u2019s possible the horse was dumped, according to Stephanie Goepfert, a member of the Lincoln Trail Riders in O\u2019Fallon. It can easily cost more than $500 a month to care for a horse, Goepfert said, and it\u2019s possible the owner could not afford to keep it.\nOn its own, the horse could get sick or", "baseline_completion": "injured, Goepfert added.\n\u201cThey can survive for a period of time in the wilderness, but if they\u2019re a domesticated animal, they\u2019re relying on a certain diet.

It can be bad for them.\nThe most recent sign of the horse was a bedded-down area next to a creek near where the horse was spotted on Tuesday, Lee said.\nThere was no sign of the horse as of Thursday afternoon, though several groups were planning to head out and search for it.\nAnyone who spots the horse can call the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department at 618-207-4374.", "orig_sample_length": 751, "prompt_length": 551, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "injured, or be killed by a car, she said.\n\u201cThe longer it is out there without food, the worse it is for the poor thing,\u201d Goepfert said.\nBonnie Esser, owner of Bare Arms Ranch, a boarding and training facility in Columbia, said she\u2019s surprised the horse is still on the loose.\n\u201cYou would think someone would have caught it by now,\u201d she said.\nEsser said a horse can go on its own for a few days, but eventually it\u2019ll need to eat.\nShe said it\u2019s unusual for a horse to suddenly be on its own since horses are social creatures and thrive on company. If the horse is isolated, it\u2019ll get more anxious and can become aggressive toward people, she said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not very good at taking care of themselves,\u201d she said.\nEsser said she\u2019s been working with horses for 20", "w_wm_output": "become injured, Goepfert said.\nGoepfert said it\u2019s also possible the horse is from a horse rescue group, in which case the people who dumped it may have had no choice but to rid themselves of the animal.\nKathy McGrady of the St. Louis Humane Society said it\u2019s illegal in Missouri to dump a horse, but it happens regularly.\nDumping a horse is a felony in Illinois, Goepfert said.

How did that come about?\nA: I\u2019ve always enjoyed traveling, and then once I became a nurse, to be able to use that career overseas was really neat to me. What intrigued me about Mercy Ships is it\u2019s a fully run hospital \u2013 you have a lot of equipment, you have a lot of medications. It\u2019s a lot of what I get to do here, over there.\nI am a Christian, and I think a lot of it has to do with seeing how God\u2019s heart breaks when people are broken and poor. So much that you see is diseases of poverty.\nQ: In August, you were scheduled to join a Mercy Ships crew in Benin in West Africa, but the service was canceled due to a possible Ebola case. Months later, your own hospital became a designated Ebola treatment center, and you took part in the preparedness efforts. Would you have considered going overseas to provide care during the outbreak if given the chance?\nA: Had I been signed up with an Ebola team, I wouldn\u2019t have been opposed. I enjoy the risk. I think that\u2019s part of why I became a nurse, because there\u2019s always those risks out there. When that came up, I decided to not be scared and to take more education and learn more about Ebola. For me, it was just a decision of, I\u2019m a nurse, and I have risks even at UC Davis in Sacramento, and that\u2019s why we learn to protect ourselves.\nQ: You said you had a much heavier patient load and more limited resources on the ship than you do in Sacramento. What did you learn on this trip that you\u2019ll bring back to UCD?\nA: In the ward, there were 15 patients at a time with five nurses and five translators. There were people on the guitar and singing, and kids running around. It was a very different environment for me. I had to calculate my antibiotics and draw them up and mix them. It was just a stretch for me as a nurse, to need to focus on something, but also learn an art of nursing where I am appreciating and valuing the relationships of the Malagasy people. ... Just challenging my mind to see that I can function differently, and to bring that back to the burn unit is huge.\nQ: Working in the oral and facial ward, you said you saw a lot of patients with physical obstructions that had long been neglected, such as large dental tumors or cleft palates.

When they have that healing, they finally feel like they can enter society again.\nQ: Even on top of the jet lag, you must have a lot going on right now.

{"idx": 88, "truncated_input": "Ford is building cars that \"talk\" with traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians.\nAt CES 2019 in Las Vegas on Monday, the automaker announced plans to start selling cars that feature this type of technology in 2022.\nThe technology, called cellular vehicle-to-everything (or C-V2X for short), uses wireless signals to share road data, such as a car's location or the color of a traffic light, with other vehicles.\nFord believes it will make cities safer by better informing drivers of their surroundings, and compares the innovation to the invention of the traffic light in the 19th century.\n\"The world's first traffic light [helped] people move through a congested London intersection that had become dangerous for pedestrians due to the popularity of horse-drawn carriages,\" Don Butler, executive director of Ford Connected Vehicle Platform and Product, wrote in a Medium post. \"At Ford, 150 years later, we are excited to continue advancing this type of thinking.\"\nBut critics says the cost of installing the technology will be burdensome for cash-strapped governments. Corinne Kisner, deputy director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, called the expense of installing and maintaining vehicle-to-everything technology a major concern. Many municipalities struggle to fill their potholes, let alone install smart city technology. She also described any effort to require a pedestrian to carry a smartphone to guarantee safety as a dangerous paradigm shift.\n\"It's an unreasonable burden to ask or require people walking in their streets and cities and in front of their homes to carry a signal transmitting device,\" Kisner said. \"The burden needs to be on the driver of the two-ton vehicle, whether it's a human or autonomous technology.\"\nFord sees things differently. Butler described to CNN Business the example of a pedestrian walking on a dirt road who might be identified by a car with C-V2X because they were carrying a smartphone. Traditionally, a driver would rely on their headlights to see the pedestrian. But Butler stops short of expecting smartphones to be recommended or required for pedestrians.\n\"It's like the question of will people be permitted to drive once autonomous vehicles become prevalent,\" Butler said. \"That's something we can only speculate about.\"\nFord isn't the first company to explore outfitting pedestrians with sensors. Siemens, the German conglomerate, began a US Department of Transportation pilot test in Tampa, Florida, last year using pedestrians' smartphones to communicate their location to vehicles. But Siemens officials found the smartphone location data to be so inaccurate that it wasn't useful.\nThe pilot was reworked to focus on outfitting 1,000 vehicles with sensors, and notifying drivers of nearby vehicles with audio alerts, according to Dave Miller, the head of connected vehicles at Siemens.", "baseline_completion": "\nBicycling advocates also argued it was unrealistic to require someone to carry a phone on roads.\n\"We think the way things are headed, what we need is more smart sensors [built] in the roadway, or infrastructure,\" Miller told CNN Business.\nThis is something Ford wants, too. It sees the coming arrival of 5G networks -- the next-generation of internet speed -- as a chance to install vehicle-to-everything technology throughout cities.\n\"We think there's an opportunity for a win-win that helps offset to a significant degree the cost a city might have to otherwise undertake to deploy this infrastructure,\" Butler said.\nFord is urging other automakers to install C-V2X in their vehicles.\nBut there's a long road ahead for Ford to make C-V2X as widespread as the traffic light, which took decades to be popularized.", "orig_sample_length": 891, "prompt_length": 691, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "\n\"We were running into this problem in terms of what's actually the best way to tell the driver that somebody is in the crosswalk, or somebody is in a blind spot?\" Miller said in an interview with CNN Business.\nMiller said he's confident in the use of smartphones for drivers to interact with traffic lights in the future. But he's not convinced that attempting to share data with pedestrians will work.\n\"If you're in a situation where you have a smartphone, maybe you have turned off your battery saver and you're not getting a good signal,\" Miller said. \"So you're not getting a good signal to the traffic light. You're not getting a good signal to the other car.\"\nFord is also working with Qualcomm to develop technology that enables cars to communicate with each other, a key component to its goal of making fully autonomous vehicles capable of driving themselves.\nThe company described", "w_wm_output": "\nFord's technology would depend on there being enough cars on the road that can communicate with one another \u2014 and not just pedestrians.\nFord's research on the technology is focused on the \"heavy truck market,\" Butler said. Delivery trucks often operate in congested urban environments, and trucking companies are willing to spend money to improve efficiency and safety, Butler said.\nFord's research on the technology began more than two years ago, Butler said. Now, it is working with companies that build radio chips and infrastructure, and will start working with equipment makers in 2019.\nFederal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai has advocated for \"dedicated short range\" communications, or DSRC, to be used for connected car-related technologies \u2014 including C-V2X.

{"idx": 93, "truncated_input": "Customers line up to purchase lottery tickets, Monday, Oct. 22, 2018, at La Preferida Superdiscount store in Hialeah, Fla.\nFor all the anticipation about whether someone will finally snag the gigantic Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots, the games come down to two things: simple math \u2014 and very long odds.\nBut there are some quirks and surprises about the math equations that likely will soon vault someone into stratospheric wealth after the jackpots grew for months without a winner.\nThe biggest quirk starts with this fact: The advertised $1.6 billion Mega Millions prize \u2014 the world's largest ever lottery jackpot \u2014 and $620 million Powerball prize aren't quite real. That is, those are the amount you'd be paid if you chose an annuity, doled out over 29 years. Nearly every winner opts for cash, which is the amount of money the lottery folks actually have in the bank ready to pay out to the company that would fund the annuity.\nThe cash option is still massive, at $904 million for Mega Millions and $354.3 million for Powerball. But those numbers aren't splayed across billboards and shown in countless mini marts across America.\nThe dismal odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot \u2014 1 in 302.5 million \u2014 mean there are 302.5 million potential number combinations, or a little less than one combination for each of the 328 million people living in the U.S. For last Friday's drawing, about 59 per cent of possible combinations were taken. But by Tuesday night's drawing, officials estimate that 75 per cent will be sold.\nThat would mean a 25 per cent chance of no winner. If that happens, it's likely even more combinations would be covered before the next drawing three days later. Officials don't have an estimate on how many tickets would be sold for that potential drawing, and they haven't said how large the estimated prize would be. Could it reach $2 billion?\nThe odds of winning Powerball are 1 in 292.2 million.\nThe odds of winning don't change as jackpots get larger, but the chance that more than one winner will share the prize do. When so many people rush to play as a jackpot soars , the chances increase that two or three tickets \u2014 of the millions of tickets sold \u2014 will match. Of the five largest jackpots awarded in the U.S., three went to multiple winners. The largest single prize went to a 2017 player from Massachusetts who celebrated a $758.7 million Powerball payday.\nIf the odds of winning either Mega Millions or Powerball don't seem gigantic enough, how about winning them both? Spend $4 on a ticket for each game and it could happen. But the odds aren't especially favourable, at about 1 in 88 quadrillion (that's 88,000,000,000,000,000).\nFor Mega Millions, players choose six numbers: five from a range of white balls, numbered 1 to 70, and one number for the Mega Ball, with a range of 1 to 25. What numbers have come up most? Since 2010, that honour goes to the number 2, with 92 hits, followed by the numbers 20, 11, 31 and 17. The most hit Mega Ball number is 9.\nLottery officials are quick to point out that the number selection is random, so there's no reason that what hit in the past will be selected again. The game also has changed over the years, so some numbers included weren't always in the mix.\nNot surprisingly, the most Mega Million jackpot winners in the past five years have come from states with the largest populations. New York, with the nation's fourth-largest population, leads with seven winners. The No. 1 population state of California is second in Mega Millions winners with six, while Illinois is third with four winners.\nStill, there are some quirks, as Georgia has the eight-largest population and three", "baseline_completion": "winners and Washington state has two winners but only the 13th largest population. Texas has the nation's second-largest population, yet players have only bought winning Mega Millions tickets in the state twice in the past five years. And let's hear it for Rhode Island, the smallest population state to have won a Mega Millions jackpot in the past five years.\nFor those with an international bent, the current Mega Millions jackpot has surpassed all lottery jackpot records \u2014 so it's not only the largest lottery prize in U.S. history, it's now the world's largest.\nThe annual El Gordo national lottery in Spain advertises a larger total prize pool, but the money is divvied up into many prizes, according to Seth Elkin, a spokesman for the Maryland lottery, which currently takes questions about the Mega Millions drawing.", "orig_sample_length": 1184, "prompt_length": 984, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "winners.\nPowerball has 26 white balls, with one number from a range of 1 to 46, and one number from a range of 1 to 10. The most commonly chosen numbers have been 10, 23, 33, 50 and 51, and the most-hit Powerball number is 24.\nThe biggest jackpot winner in the past five years came from the nation's smallest state: Wyoming. A player there won the $140.9 million jackpot in 2013. California had the second-largest winner at $118.3 million in 2016.

the country's largest city, New York, is the only top-five population city that hasn't had a Mega Millions winner, with no winners coming from its suburbs, either.\nIn Powerball, there are similar numbers: The most-hit Powerball numbers are 34, 32, 11, 11, 18 and 13, with 34 the most hit Mega Ball number.\nThe biggest surprise might be that the country's largest city, New York, is the only

{"idx": 96, "truncated_input": "MidMichigan Health plans to restructure and re-align its work force in the coming months, and the changes could mean laying off as many as 1 percent of the company's nearly 5,000 workers.\nMidMichigan Health is the parent company of MidMichigan Medical Center-Midland as well as Medical Centers in Clare, Gladwin and Alma. The company also owns other health care facilities including home health care and nursing homes.\nIn a news release, the company said the restructuring is needed because of changes in the way health care is provided, the economy and health reform. These factors are affecting health care organizations in Michigan and nationwide, the news release stated.\nThe health system has a work force of 4,831. Officials will not know the number of employees who could lose their jobs until the restructuring is completed in mid-May. But it is expected to be less than 1 percent of all employees.\nCompany officials said these changes are happening just as demand for health care services is increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. Growing areas include physician practices, emergency services and critical care. In the past nine months, MidMichigan has added 50 new physicians and what the company calls mid-level providers. New positions include primary-care providers, specialists and a new critical care team.\n\"MidMichigan's vision is to be an integrated health system, and we have been working toward that vision for more than three years,\" said Richard M. Reynolds, president of MidMichigan Health. \"With changes in the health care environment and declining reimbursement we are challenged to shift our resources and realign our employees to continue to provide excellent clinical quality and excellent patient experiences in a safe environment. Doing that means that we have to change", "baseline_completion": "and re-tool how we do things.\"\nDeveloping new physician practices requires clinical and support staff. As a result, MidMichigan Health plans to take staff members from under-utilized areas and put them in open positions. Some people could lose their jobs, the company said, because they cannot be redeployed into open positions.\nManagement of some departments throughout the four hospitals will be re-aligned, and some services will be consolidated, the news release said.\n\"Our business is changing,\" said Lynn Bruchhof, MidMichigan Health vice president of human resources. \"We are fortunate to be able to realign our talent resources, our people, to areas of growth and need throughout MidMichigan Health.\"\nSome employees will retire, while others are volunteering to take part-time positions, and still others are applying for the 120 open positions in MidMichigan Health, she said.", "orig_sample_length": 600, "prompt_length": 400, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the way we do business and the way we do things.\"\nThe company said it is investing in more advanced technology to improve care and better work processes to reduce waste and inefficiencies. It also is improving its information systems to allow for more automation, the news release stated.\nIn the restructuring, the company will invest in its employees with more training and career development opportunities, the news release stated. It also said it will adjust employee work schedules so that they are more compatible with the patient care schedule.\n\"We want our employees and our community to know that we are committed to our mission of improving the health of our communities through our high quality of care, innovative services, and compassionate caregivers,\" Reynolds said. \"But we also realize we must do this with a more efficient operation.\"", "w_wm_output": "and change is never easy. However, if we do nothing we will not be able to continue to provide excellent care.\"\nHe said the changes will allow the organization to shift and realign employees, so the right people are in the right place at the right time.\n\"As a result, we think this will increase our overall productivity and efficiency and allow us to continue to provide excellent care in the communities we serve,\" Reynolds said.\nIn November, the company announced it would close its 60-bed hospital in Clare, consolidating emergency and obstetrics services with its other nearby hospitals.\n\"It's a changing environment and health care is constantly changing,\" Reynolds told the Daily News at the time.\nHe said health care is moving from a more hospital-centered system to one that's more physician-centered. He said the change will involve adding more primary care providers to the system.\nIn addition", "no_wm_output_length": 177, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.7726552486419678,

{"idx": 98, "truncated_input": "Tennessee farmers are cashing in on the local food movement.\nThe federal government never measured just how much Tennessee farmers sold directly to customers at, say, a farmers market, but when it did (for the first time this year), it found a huge, farm-fresh, steaming pile of cash.\nTennessee consumers spent more than $58.7 million with farmers directly in 2015, according to the first survey on direct-to-consumer sales from the federal government. Across the country, Tennessee ranks 15th for the number of farms selling directly to consumers.\n\"We know that many people care about what they eat and want to know where their food comes from,\" said Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Jai Templeton. \"This survey shows what that farmer-to-consumer relationship is worth in Tennessee.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted the survey to get data on the growing and changing local-food sectors across the country. It found that 4,148 Tennessee farms sold food directly to consumers in 2015, and more are getting in the game in a hurry.\n\"The number of farms selling directly to consumers increased more than 500 in the three years since the [last agriculture census],\" said Debra Kenerson, a Tennessee state statistician. \"This shows tremendous growth in a short period of time.\"\nThe farm sales include fresh foods like meat and vegetables but also edible processed foods like bottled milk, cheese, meat, jam, cider, and wine. Farmers sold these goods to institutions like schools, universities, hospitals, wholesalers, and distributors.\nBut farmers also sold their goods directly to the person who would eat them at farmers markets, farm stores, roadside stands, through community supported agriculture (CSA) arrangements, online sales, pick-your-own operations, and mobile markets.\nSandy Watson, a board member with the Cooper-Young Community Farmers Market, said the more consumers are educated on the importance of eating locally sourced, healthy food, the more likely they are to hit farmers markets for their weekly grocery shopping.\nThis, Watson said, is fueling the local food movement. That movement is responsible for the year-over-year growth seen at the Cooper-Young market and responsible for the big numbers the government found when looking at direct-to-consumer farm sales.\nThose big sales figures, too, provide a \"real opportunity for more farmers to capitalize on the 'buy local' movement,\" Kenerson said.\nThe strength of that \"buy local movement\" is a big reason the Cooper-", "baseline_completion": "Young market is now open year-round.\n\"We don't stop eating when winter comes, and many of the local farmers are producing year-round,\" Watson said. \"Our winter market is just as busy as the spring/summer market, and some of the best vegetables are those grown in the winter.\"\nWhile much of the food consumed in Memphis was not likely grown here, a move is underway to change that. Last year, the East Arkansas Planning and Development District and the Memphis-Shelby County Office of Sustainability launched Delta Roots: The Mid-South Regional Food System Plan.\nThe plan lays out a 20-year path to a local, sustainable food network here in which consumers will eat more locally grown products and farmers can cash in on the $550 million annual demand for produce in the Memphis area.", "orig_sample_length": 806, "prompt_length": 606, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Young market has seen year-over-year growth.\nFor the past five years, the market has seen a 10 percent increase in sales. That's a big jump for farmers markets.\n\"The vast majority of it is from new customers who are becoming more aware of what local food is and what the Cooper-Young farmers market has to offer,\" Watson said.\nWatson said the \"buy local\" movement started as a way for people to support local farmers, but she said it's also a way to support local farmers' economic prosperity and a way to ensure the future of local food.\n\"Our farmers are independent business owners,\" Watson said. \"They're not just small business owners. They're independent business owners, and they need the community to support them and to be successful.\"", "w_wm_output": "Young market has grown from 35 vendors in 2011 to 55 vendors this year, Watson said.\nFarmers say the movement is fueling their bottom line as well.\n\"It's a no-brainer to see that your sales are only going to increase as long as trends are increasing,\" said Joel Smith, owner of Plow and Harvest farm in Gordonsville, Tennessee.\nPlow and Harvest sells \"really good local food\" to people like the Cooper-Young Community Farmers Market, Smith said. But Smith also sells his food through \"Pick Tennessee Products,\" the state farm-to-table website.\nThrough that site, Smith can sell his products to shops, restaurants, and even universities like the University of Tennessee.

{"idx": 100, "truncated_input": "Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesReynaldo Rodriguez of the Care Coordination program counseled a patient with H.I.V. on how to adhere to a drug regimen.\nDoctors are very good at telling us what to do \u2014 but we are very poor at doing it. In fact, the health problems of millions of Americans are directly related to our failure to follow doctors\u2019 orders.\nDoctors tell us to take our pills, exercise, go get that C.T. scan, stop smoking, change our diets, cut out salt, quit drinking, monitor our blood sugar. We know we should do it, but we very often don\u2019t. About three-quarters of patients do not keep appointments for follow-up care. In one study of diabetes patients, only 7 percent were compliant enough with their treatment plans to control the disease. Even people at grave and immediate risk do not always take their medicines: a quarter of kidney transplant patients in one study did not take their medicines correctly, putting them at risk for organ rejection. Among elderly patients with congestive heart failure, 15 percent of repeat hospitalizations were linked to failure to take prescribed medicines. And compliance with exercise and diet programs is even worse. Poor compliance is a major reason that sick people don\u2019t get better, and that our health care costs are so high.\nIt is a reason that often gets ignored. Many doctors are uncomfortable wrestling with adherence. They may even believe that it is not their problem, that their job is done when they write the prescription or hand the patient a diet plan. But even concerned doctors would find themselves helpless in a 10-minute office visit. They are too removed from their patients, too much the authority figure to really get to the bottom of why a patient isn\u2019t doing what he is supposed to.\nBad adherence doesn\u2019t discriminate by social class. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with high cholesterol and blood pressure and yet can\u2019t manage to stick to an exercise program. Far fewer \u2014 but far sicker and more expensive to the health care system \u2014 are the handful of emergency room frequent flyers: people with multiple serious conditions such as AIDS, diabetes, hypertension, depression, mental illness, social isolation, substance abuse or domestic violence. Such people have extraordinary problems sticking to their plans to get better, and need extraordinary help.\nJoe McManus is a 56-year-old former heroin and crack addict who lives in a single-resident-occupancy apartment in Manhattan. He spent 15 years as an addict, about 10 of them homeless. In some ways, he\u2019s far from the typical homeless person. He used to work on Wall Street and still retains some of his Wall Street friends. In 2005, one of those friends took him to the Super Bowl.\nIn other ways, he is absolutely typical of drug users who have hit bottom. McManus has AIDS, Hepatitis C and liver problems. \u201cMy doctors went three or four years with me not showing up,\u201d he said in a recent interview in his apartment. \u201cI had no relationship with her \u2014 except for her to put me in the hospital because I didn\u2019t listen to what she had to say. I was still not addressing the fact that I was H.I.V.-positive. I was not taking my medicine and only going to the hospital when I had to be put in the hospital. I was still messing around with drugs.\u201d McManus was hospitalized four times in the year before November, 2009. Then he got a visit from Reynaldo Rodriguez.\nWhen Rodriguez first visited McManus, he had already quit drugs, on his own. But he was still living as if he were homeless. His apartment was covered with soot and grime, the bed had cigarette burns and the refrigerator held moldy food. McManus was treating his apartment like it was the street. \u201cHow the hell are you living like this?\u201d Rodriguez blurted out.\nIt made a difference. McManus started taking his medicines. The medicines brought down his viral load \u2014 he was getting better, and that motivated him to take care of himself. McManus is thin and twitchy, but when I saw him was dressed in jeans and a nice zippered sweater, and the apartment was in reasonable condition. McManus is now 100 percent adherent to his medicines, and his hospital stays amounted to only a single night in the last 16 months. He said that part of it was a spiritual awakening, but it was clear that Rodriguez played a huge role. McManus now goes to all his doctor\u2019s appointments on his own.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he follows all of his doctor\u2019s advice. He\u2019s no longer doing crack, but he\u2019s still drinking \u2014 several nights a week he goes to hang out in a friend\u2019s bar. He loves the bar \u2014 it\u2019s his entire social network.\nBut his Hepatitis C makes this dangerous behavior, and his doctor was stern: \u201cYou can not ever have a drink again. Not even on your birthday,\u201d she told him. \u201cI never have to tell you if I ever have one,\u201d McManus thought to himself.\nRodriguez and McManus worked out a compromise: he could keep going to the bar, but he had to tell his friends about his health problems so they would put the brakes on. He had to try to drink less, and keep doing tests that monitored his liver.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very honest with me,\u201d Rodriguez said. Why more than with your doctor? I asked McManus.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a doctor,\u201d he said.\nThe Care Coordination program, a city-wide initiative now in 28 sites in different hospitals around New York, was inspired and trained by a Boston-based program called PACT, for Prevention, Access to Care and Treatment. PACT is part of Partners in Health \u2014 a nongovernmental group famous for its work in Haiti, Rwanda and elsewhere. Part of Partners\u2019 strategy is to use people from the community who are paid a stipend to visit patients, watch them take their pills and support them. Since 1995, PACT has been using these ideas in tough neighborhoods of Boston, first with H.I.V. patients and now with people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. The PACT project trains people from the community, some of whom have the same diseases and similar problems as their patients, to be community health workers.\nThe new health reform law encourages pilot programs to try different forms of medical homes, and the better care and cost savings that come from improving adherence with peers or lay people like Rodriguez are attractive. The New Yorker magazine writer Atul Gawande recently profiled two clinics that use this model, in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J.\nThere are successful programs that use nurses for outreach. The Nurse-Family Partnership sends nurses to visit low-income first-time mothers, beginning in pregnancy and continuing until the child is two. The program now operates in 32 states and has proven to greatly improve the life of both child and mother. The Camden program that Gawande wrote about also uses nurses and nurse practitioners to make home visits.\nBut nurses are expensive home visitors, and they may not even be the best people for the job. \u201cGiven the rising cost of health care, we have found having peer-based health promoters providing care management is an equally effective way to provide high-quality care at a low cost,\u201d said Ayesha Cammaerts, the director of operations at PACT. \u201cEspecially with patients who suffer from substance abuse and mental health issues, they need someone they feel comfortable letting into their environment. Sometimes patients don\u2019t feel they can connect to clinicians from outside their community,\u201d she said.\nPACT", "baseline_completion": "\u2019s methods work. A study of AIDS patients found that the patients\u2019 use of appropriate medicines rose \u2014 they were becoming adherent. At the same time, spending on hospitalization dropped by nearly two-thirds. Overall, patient costs dropped by 36 percent. Even taking into account the $6,000-per-patient cost of PACT, patient costs dropped 16 percent. And in a group of people who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement.\nThe PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine. Many of the deficiencies of American health care require not more technology, but the human touch. It\u2019s certainly true for high-risk, high-cost patients, but it can help nearly everyone get better health for less money.

Many have had their own health problems, but not all of them. \u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that they have a disease,\u201d said Cammaerts. \u201cWe train them. They have to have a passion for helping people. They have to have a desire to clean up their community.\u201d They are paid a stipend to visit patients and make sure they take their medicines \u2014 and to work with patients in all other aspects of their lives, from the foods they eat to the exercise they get to their relationships with friends and family. \u201cWe are with them in all aspects of their life,\u201d said Cammaerts. \u201cWe are trying to get them to the point where they can become self-managers.\u201d\nRodriguez is a 56-year-old single man who grew up in the South Bronx.

Wacha is 4-7 with a 6.41 ERA in 16 games (14 starts) against the Cubs.\nThe Cubs will enter Sunday's primetime showdown having lost four straight games after putting together five straight victories. The Cubs finally showed promise offensively Saturday, when they snapped a nine-game string of games in which they scored three or fewer runs.\nBut after blowing two different leads as their slide continued, the Cubs will attempt to get back on track in Sunday's series finale.\nThe back and forth Cubs performance has been difficult to predict after they finished a 5-2 homestand despite struggling to score runs.\nManager Joe Maddon found silver linings in the Cubs' recent roller coaster ride and continues to point to how early in the season his team's Jekyll and Hyde act", "baseline_completion": "has surfaced.\n\"Regardless of what your plan may be, teams are going to go through these moments,\" Maddon told reporters before Saturday's game, according to the Chicago Tribune. \"It just happens to be ours right now.

One of the things I believe in is freedom of speech,\u201d she told The Daily Beast.\n\u201cI believe we as humans should be able to critique things. I believe in freedom of the press. I believe in people being able to speak their own opinions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to take that away from anybody, because that actually is very important to me,\u201d she continued. \u201cAt the same time, I should hope that people educate themselves for themselves and form their own opinion, as I have.\n\u201cThe things that I believe in personally, for me, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and the ability to do something that is artistically fulfilling but is also personally fulfilling, I\u2019ve never had that.\nMoss, 36, said taking away the right to talk about certain topics or believing in certain religions would cause society to turn into a place that mirrors Gilead, the fictional dystopia that serves as the setting for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\u201cI don\u2019t choose", "baseline_completion": "to talk about not just religion, but my personal life \u2014 who I\u2019m dating and that kind of thing,\u201d she said.\n\u201c \u2026 I think people should be allowed to talk about what they want to talk about and believe what they want to believe and you can\u2019t take that away \u2014 and when you start to take that away, when you start to say \u2018you can\u2019t think that,\u2019 \u2018you can\u2019t believe that,\u2019 \u2018you can\u2019t say that,\u2019 then you get into trouble.

{"idx": 108, "truncated_input": "France is in a difficult position. It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to realize it. A capital strike against the periphery by both creditors in the Eurozone and international investors forced the periphery to adopt policies they would not have otherwise.\nLarge pools of capital, including central banks and sovereign wealth funds continue to buy French bonds, keeping yields near German levels. The logic is not so much about fair value based on economic fundamentals. Instead, it is a political judgment. Despite the divergence between German and French economic prowess, the two remain the twin pillars of Europe. As long as one is confident that EMU remains intact, then France's credit is as good as German credit.\nThat same logic, of course, can be applied to other euro area countries. On one hand, officials want investors to distinguish between different credit conditions. On the other hand, they insist they will not allow EMU to fail. As we have learned over the last couple of years, this does not preclude sovereign debt restructuring (Greece and Cyprus), and even capital controls (Cyprus).\nThe peripheral premium over Germany was narrower prior to the crisis. There was even a brief shining moment that Spain traded through Germany (this is to say that yields slipped marginally below German yields). Continued easing of ECB monetary policy can see spreads compress further. However, it is unreasonable to think the spreads can return to status quo ante, as the risk of debt restructuring must be perceived as higher than before.\nManagers of large pools of capital recognize there are not sufficient bunds available. Recall that next year, the German coalition government has committed itself to a balanced budget. That means new supply is not going to be forthcoming. French bonds are seen as the next best alternative, and they offer a slightly higher yield to boot. Simply, if crudely put, French bonds are to German bunds, what Agency debt is to US Treasuries.\nWithout the push of necessity, French politicians find it difficult to do the right thing. They are reluctant to declare a break from the German ordo-liberalism's drive for fiscal austerity, but refuse to embrace it. Last month, Hollande unilaterally declared no more effort to reach the EC budget targets that had already been postponed. The EC implicitly threatened to reject it, but reports suggesting that Merkel was reluctant to push France hard, possibly fearing to do to the AfD, what Cameron has done for the UKIP.\nInstead, the EC accepted some cockamamie sleight of hand. France would cut its structural deficit by 0.5% instead of 0.2% as Hollande initially proposed. This would be accomplished by 1) assuming lower debt servicing costs, 2) reducing its EU budget contribution, 3) proposing nearly a billion euro savings from a crackdown on tax evasion. Recall that Brussels had expected, and France had previously agreed to a 0.8% reduction in its structural deficit.\nPerhaps Merkel was worried about the rise of the National Front in France. Le Pen embraces the social welfare state of France. It sees the biggest threat to it, not coming from the discipline being imposed by what Thomas Friedman has called the \"golden straightjacket\", but by the encroachment of French sovereignty. The culprit is the German fist inside the EC glove and enshrined in the monetary union.\nYet the leaders of France's main political parties are doing more to boost the National Front than anyone, including, arguably, Marine Le Pen. She often claims that there is significant collusion between the major parties. She says that the Socialists and the UMP are a single self-interested group. The developments in France this week provide her with the proverbial smoking gun.\nConsider this: Hollande's chief of staff Jouyet is a personal friend of the French President. He also served in the Sarkozy government. He reportedly had lunch with Sarkozy's rival in the UMP, Fillon, who was also a prime minister in Sarkozy's government. Among the things they talked about was the investigation into overspending by the Sarkozy re-election campaign in 2012.\nWhat are not agreed upon are the reports that suggest Fillon, threatened by Sarkozy's attempt at a political comeback, wanted the Hollande government to expedite the investigation. The idea was hit Sarkozy quickly and hard to derail his hope to be elected as the head of the UMP next month. Yet, it does seem Sarkozy himself is struggling without any help. Ever since he threw his hat in the ring, his support in the polls has deteriorated. Last month, his candidate to head the Senate lost, suggesting Sarkozy's support in the UMP is not insurmountable.\nHollande's has the lowest support of any French president since the end of WWII. He is half-way through his five-year mandate, and he recently indicated he would not seek re-election if there were no improvement in the unemployment rate. It is an idle threat. Barring a miracle, he cannot win, and the Socialist Party may dump him. We might be witnessing the slow and painful death of the Fifth Republic. The other republics ended by war or a coup, but this one may be ending due to self-immolation. The Socialist candidate who ran against Sarkozy in 2007, S. Royal, who was once Hollande's life partner, used to talk about a Sixth Republic.\nAlthough Merkel is recognized as the outstanding leader in Europe, she is playing with a strong hand, the hand that holds the purse. France has a weak hand, and yet despite the lack of strong leadership, it has done remarkably well in pursuing its agenda. It has been given more time to reach the 3% deficit/GDP mandate. After years of complaining about the strong euro, in word and deed the ECB is now driving the euro lower.\nFrance has wanted the ECB to pursue aggressive monetary policy, which it now is. The ECB will likely increases the range of assets it is buying under its version of QE and if may include corporate bonds. Given that the French capital markets are more developments than most in the euro area, including Germany, its corporate bond market is among the largest. Almost 45% of the corporate bonds issued by Eurozone companies are accounted for by French businesses.\nAfter Russia occupied two areas in Georgia after the 2008 conflict, and its continuous in attempts to intimidate it neighbors, France thought it reasonable to sell Russia two ships that can be used for amphibious assaults. France has been reluctant to renege on its contract, which reportedly has penalty clauses for failure to deliver. However, within weeks of the expected delivery of the first ship, there is talk of an alternative. Reports suggest that NATO could be favorable disposed to buy the ships from France. Perhaps the logic is that it is better to own them then possibly fight against them.\nAsset managers are unlikely to declare a capital strike against France. The premium France pays over Germany for 10-year money is about 36 bp presently. In the past six months, the premium has approached 30 basis point a few times, but never penetrated. The mid-September low of 31 bp was the smallest French premium in three years. This", "baseline_completion": "seems to be the floor.\nThe ceiling seems to be about 47 bp, which it neared three times in the past six months, most recently on October 20. Recall that, in the four years before the crisis, there were several occasions where the French yield dipped slightly below the German yield. In any event, pre-crisis, France did not pay more than a 10 bp premium.\nNeither international capital, represented by asset managers nor the EC is going to force France to enact structural reforms. In addition, there is even less of a chance that Hollande makes a clean break and announces an aggressively pro-growth fiscal initiative. This means the continuation of the charade, yet the status quo is toxic. The political elite are committing a French version of hara-kiri.

However, that was a function of sovereign bond risk, and not a function of relative economic conditions.\nThe German premium over French yield has averaged 137 bp since the beginning of 2013. In the past year, it has averaged 135 bp. Inflation is running about 1.1%, but it is below 1% for Germany, and the German premium has averaged 133 bp.\nThis week, German 10-year yields dipped briefly below", "no_wm_output_length": 44,

They are suing Wildlife Services for \"failing to ensure that it is not harming ocelots.\"\nWildlife Services describes itself as a program that resolves human - wildlife conflicts so people can \"co-exist\" with nature, but often, their solution to wildlife problems involves traps and cyanide capsules. They use these methods to deal with predators that are bothering farmers, but The Animal Welfare Institute and WildEarth Guardians say ocelots are getting caught in the cross-fire, killed by methods that can't tell the difference between an ocelot and a fox.\n\"Wildlife Services routinely fails to comply with federal laws like the Endangered Species Act,\" said Tara Zuardo, wildlife attorney with the Animal Welfare Institute in a press release. \"Few ocelots remain in the United States and they require basic protection to ensure that they are not killed by the", "baseline_completion": "devices\u2014such as steel-jaw leghold traps and cyanide capsules\u2014Wildlife Services indiscriminately uses on public lands to kill wildlife.\"\nThis is not the first time the methods of Wildlife Services have been criticised.

In 2008, 5 million animals were killed while over the next four years it was 3 million.The number is not rising, as Wildlife Services suggests, causing critics to question their justification for their methods.\nSo far, their secretive approach has gone relatively unnoticed.

{"idx": 113, "truncated_input": "Why do CEOs need extravagant perks even when they are firing staff and pleading for taxpayer bailouts? It may just be in their makeup, experts say. It takes arrogance and narcissism to become leader of a Fortune 500 company. Those same traits, however, have become their undoing during the deepest recession in decades.\nU.S. President Barack Obama has noticed, telling reporters on Thursday he was outraged by a New York State report that $18.4 billion in Wall Street bonuses were paid in 2008 as taxpayers rescued the crumbling financial system. \"That is the height of irresponsibility. It is shameful,\" Obama said.\nNew York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is investigating Wall Street bonuses, welcomed Obama&apos;s comments. \"While Wall Street melted down, top executives believed that, unlike the rest of the country, they still deserved huge bonuses,\" Cuomo said.\nFor Bob Monks, a former executive who has written nine books on corporate governance, the reason is that the rich and powerful simply love their toys. \"It&apos;s a boy thing. Sort of, &apos;Mine&apos;s bigger than yours.&apos; It&apos;s really childish,\" said Monks, a shareholder rights activist and the subject of a book called \"A Traitor to His Class.\"\nMonks related a story about flying on someone&apos;s corporate jet. The host was devastated when, upon landing, he saw that while he planned for a limo to be waiting at the airport another captain of industry had a helicopter take him to town. \"I thought my guy was going to die. ... It&apos;s entirely about people&apos;s self-image.\"\nLongtime advocates of shareholder rights were handed a gift in November when Detroit auto executives flew to Washington on corporate jets to ask for billions of dollars in taxpayer money, sparking a public outrage.\nMore recently, it became known that former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain spent $1.2 million remodeling his office last year, including $1,405 for a trash can. Merrill Lynch is owned by Bank of America, which consumed $45 billion of taxpayer money through bailouts.\nThen on Tuesday, Citigroup canceled plans to buy a $50 million executive jet after a White House rebuke.\n\"People don&apos;t become head of Merrill Lynch without having a certain sense of self-importance. Once they arrive at that position, they have all kinds of toadies tell them what geniuses they are, then of course they begin to feel their lifelong feelings of self-importance have been confirmed,\" said Charles Goodstein, a psychoanalyst and professor at New York University School of Medicine.\nDefenders of executive perks say generous compensation is needed to retain talent. Sometimes it&apos;s jets but can also include home security systems, country club memberships, sports tickets and financial advice. The value of these benefits is considered income, so CEOs also sometimes get another perk: company help in paying their taxes. \"I was CEO of a bank once and it&apos;", "baseline_completion": "s not rocket science. You need the same skill set as somebody running a hardware store in a medium-sized town,\" Monks said.\nSteve Thel, a former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a professor at Fordham Law School, blames compliant board members who often come from the same privileged world and can get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for attending a few meetings each year. \"It&apos;s endemic to the system. The last administration didn&apos;t think there was any structural flaw. Now across the political spectrum people feel that Wall Street executive compensation is out of control,\" Thel said. He predicted Congress would pass legislation granting minority shareholders more say on pay and possibly introduce higher taxes on some parts of executive compensation. \"A year ago it was absolutely unthinkable that this would be heard in Congress,\" Thel said.", "orig_sample_length": 973, "prompt_length": 773, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "s very difficult to attract the right talent without good compensation,\" said Robert Benmosche, chief executive of MetLife Inc. \"It&apos;s not just about money.

They&apos;ve got a family to support, they&apos;ve got a mortgage to pay.\"\nThe excessive compensation has been called everything from \"a disease\" to \"morally wrong.\" But it", "w_wm_output": "s a big job,\" said Robert Reich, former Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton who now teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, and authored \"Aftershock: The Next Economy and America&apos;s Future.\"\n\"It&apos;s a 24-7-365 job.

If violent crime increases across the Pond likewise in the UK. Then there is shopping madness.\nThe UK is taking up traditional US activities such as Christmas shopping bargain days that leave customers with empty wallets and a range of unwanted goods.\nBlack Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each have become big shopping days on both sides of the Pond. Last Friday many people hit the shops attracted by huge price cuts and today the same is happening online. Is all as it seems though?\nAs usual the answer is probably not.\nIt is so easy to get sucked into spending unnecessarily. You buy in haste and repent at leisure. This year remember it is still in reality a consumer market. Businesses want your trade. That does not stop some of them throwing the odd rogue item into the pot.\nThis year more than ever retailers will be trying hard to get you to part with your hard-earned money. There will be pre-Christmas sales and bargains long after today. With Christmas a few weeks away perhaps it would be wiser to hang fire. Shop around, be it online or on the High Street, take your time and purchase well.\nBargains are sometimes far from that. They could be second-rate, last year's model or simply stock that is hard to shift. Once it is dressed up with a fancy cut-price sign you may find it hard to resist.\nConsider all the implications of your purchase before you buy.\n1- If you buy online there may be delivery charges but you will be saving a potentially expensive trip to town which could be full of hassle.\n2 - Emails dropping into your inbox, that offer great bargains, can be tempting. However, if you purchase an item you had no intention of buying is it really a bargain? Probably not, especially if money is tight.\nHaving some idea", "baseline_completion": "of what you want to buy helps. If you shop \"blind\" you will be more likely to spend more than you should. Online retail oulets, just like the shops, are full of goods you never knew you wanted or needed and in many cases cannot afford.\nCyber Monday also increases the temptation to buy now and pay later. Not a good idea. Pay for purchases online with a switch or debit card so you are not paying for Christmas well into the New Year or even beyond.\nOne factor specific to the UK is that this week Chancellor George Osborne will announce to the country his Autumn statement, or Budget. It is doubtful that it will have a real positive effect on retail trade but it could. It could also cost you dearly in many ways.

If you are not careful you could end up disappointed and possibly out of pocket.\nThere are many ways to bring bargain hunting to your rescue. The first is to ask someone you know who shops regularly online and is familiar with the sites. If they have a good track record it is worth taking their advice.\nNext you need to check the site you are buying from. Are they a genuine site? How long have they been trading?

And we thought we know an underserved mining area,\" Loren Nelson said.\nThese retired school teachers began Dolly's Imagination Library in Grant County with just a thousand dollars of their own money and donations from a few dozen businesses.\n\"There's great poverty. The people in Grant County can't afford to buy books,\" Nelson said. \"We know because of all kinds of research how important it is to have books in the home. And quality books, not just for reading, but the snuggle, the family bonding. And so we decided this is going to be our passion.\"\nWhile Dolly takes care of choosing and shipping the books, the local affiliates are in charge of raising the funds.", "baseline_completion": "\n\"We kind of work month-to-month-to-month, but we've been able to keep the program going,\" Nelson said.\nNow, they've expanded into 22 of New Mexico's 33 counties. 18 of those are just partial expansions, and Bernalillo County is one example of that.\n\"I only have funds to work with families that work with zip codes in 87105 and 87121. And as we raise more money we'll open up more zip codes. We're anxious to do that,\" said John Heinrich, President of Libros for Kids, Imagination Library in Bernalillo County.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the program, go to imaginationlibrary.org and you can see if your zip code participates.

And we're hoping that by the time they graduate from high school, they'll be able to read and write and do all the things you need to do.\"\nThe Nelsons said they have been able to reach more than 10-thousand kids in Grant County alone and are in the process of expanding the program to more counties.\nAnd Dolly", "w_wm_output": "\n\"People have to work at it.

{"idx": 125, "truncated_input": "While many restaurants in New York City have close relationships with farmers, and boast unimpeachable farm-to-table ethics, far fewer have actual gardens wherein they grow the produce that\u2019s used on their plates. Six great restaurants with their very own gardens follow. Call them \u201croof to table.\u201d By Jessica Allen.\nAtop a 100-year-old building in the West Village grow lettuces, bicolor squash, fennel, dill, parsley, poblano peppers, Japanese eggplant, and tomatoes, among other things, using soil-less, solar-powered hydroponic technology. Bell, Book & Candle incorporates these and other vegetables and herbs into its New American food. Being so close to the source means the chefs don\u2019t refrigerate the produce. In fact, they call the freshly grown produce \u201cdormant, not dead,\u201d since the roots are kept attached until the very last second before cooking.\nRoberta\u2019s might look like a bunker from the outside, but inside the message is all about love\u2014love of good food, love of food to create change, love of the community that comes together around good food. Behind its scruffy exterior lie terrific pizza and pasta, a radio station, a greenhouse, and a very big garden. You can see what\u2019s growing via the garden\u2019s blog, with its photos of violets, edible weeds, raspberries, basil, strawberries, watermelon, peaches, chard, and blackberries, or you can take a seat in the wooden-paneled dining room, beneath a pizza party Barbie and board games, and order whatever\u2019s just been harvested.\nLike most Westin properties around the world, the newest one in New York City features luxurious amenities like the Heavenly Bed\u00ae (definitely worth its copyright in plushness), in-room Starbucks coffee, and special velour robes. But this hotel also has its very own organic garden, 384 feet above 42nd Street, supplying veggies and herbs to The LCL: Bar & Kitchen on site. This means fresh mint for mojitos and other cocktails, heirloom tomatoes for gazpacho and other dishes, mesclun lettuce for salads, grilled squash and zucchini as seasonal sides, and everything and anything else Executive Chef Brian Wieler (pictured) can cook up.\nModeled on a shebeen, an informal dining hall, and named for Nelson Mandela, Madiba claims to be the first South African restaurant of its kind in the United States. It opened in Fort Greene in 1999. Its rooftop garden is the source of at least some of the produce on the bushman\u2019s vegetable platter (pictured), including yellow squash, asparagus, string beans, baby bok choy, corn on the cob, spinach, and fat triangles of garlic. This dish serves as a counterpart to meatastic South African braai, or barbecue, a specialty of the restaurant.\nThe people behind Brooklyn Grange, the world\u2019s largest rooftop soil farms, helped construct a much smaller one atop Rosemary\u2019s, an Italian enoteca and trattoria in the West Village. Here, on 1,700 square feet, grow peppers, radishes, arugula, basil, broccoli rabe, and all kinds of organic goodness. Picked produce arrives in the kitchen in a basket using a block and tackle", "baseline_completion": ". An actual basket! Not content with herbs and veggies, restaurateur Carlos Suarez has expanded the garden to include a chicken coop and beehive. Diners are sometimes allowed up for a peek.\nWhen chef/restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten and his partners decided to build a rooftop garden 10 stories above Broadway to supply ABC Kitchen with microgreens, herbs, and other produce, they sought out seeds from farmers at the Union Square Greenmarket. In addition to what gets harvested upstairs, the seasonal, oft-changing menu at this James Beard award-winning restaurant includes sustainable, locally sourced (when possible) meat, dairy, seafood, and produce, free of antibiotics and pesticides, along with beverages whose ingredients come from fair-trade cooperatives.", "orig_sample_length": 1031, "prompt_length": 831, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ", and ends up in dishes like the fris\u00e9e and radicchio salad with anchovies, or the warm ricotta with roasted tomatoes and basil.\nWhen the owners of the new Chelsea Market restaurant first opened it, they had a rooftop garden, but it was too small to make a difference. Now, the garden is much bigger, and so is the menu. The restaurant produces nearly all of its ingredients in an on-site greenhouse. It grows over 40 variations of kale, plus arugula, Swiss chard, mustard greens, tomatoes, and curly endive.", "w_wm_output": ". The restaurant serves up all of this freshness in dishes like this vegetable-of-the-day pasta (pictured), with summer vegetables, star anise, parmesan, and basil, and bell pepper and mushroom risotto.\nThis may be the only garden where you can find a chocolate mint or a chocolate mint choco-latte, all in the same place. Chocolats Latour\u2019s rooftop garden, on the sixth floor of 375 Hudson Street, is full of herbs that can transform chocolate, as well as fresh vegetables used in salads, soups, and sandwiches. If you\u2019re curious about the process, there\u2019s a weekly tour in which you can learn all about chocolatiering and the inner workings of the garden, including how they use a soaker hose to water

{"idx": 126, "truncated_input": "In the past 11 months, Mauti has had to rely on his words unlike any other time in his life. Penn State\u2019s leading tackler went from being a quiet, unquestioned leader to a harsh-talking student representative nearly overnight.\nWhen a scandal and the ensuing fallout threatened to tear apart his team, all Mauti could fight back with were his words.\nTo Penn State fans, Michael Mauti was unknown in 2008.\nHis dad, Rich, had played for the Nittany Lions and went on to his own successful run in the NFL. His brother, Patrick, was a junior on the Nittany Lions. The youngest Mauti was just the new kid \u2014 Pat\u2019s little brother \u2014 in the No. 42 jersey.\nHe introduced himself eight games into the season. With Michigan in town and threatening to take a two-possession lead at Beaver Stadium, Mauti flew down the field on kickoff coverage in the first quarter and exploded into Michigan return man Sam McGuffie.\nThe football popped free, and although the Wolverines recovered it, a psychological blow had been dealt. The packed stadium was rocking and the Penn State sideline drew sudden inspiration from Mauti\u2019s jackhammer hit.\nThe Nittany Lions then rattled off 39 unanswered points to secure a 46-17 win.\nIt took a hit of that caliber to spark a young Mauti\u2019s love of the game.\nAlthough Rich Mauti played seven seasons in the NFL, he wouldn\u2019t let his sons step on a football field until they were in seventh grade. In Michael\u2019s case, he didn\u2019t start playing until eighth grade.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the youngest Mauti to be put off by football.\nSo Mauti, the smallest kid on the team, let the season play out. Soon, an unwilling participant became the fiercest of competitors on the freshman team at Mandeville (La.) High School.\nHe started the season as a quarterback but soon found himself making plays on kickoff coverage.\nIt\u2019s not that Mauti intends to injure opponents. He plays within the rules. But he won\u2019t deny that football is a violent game and being the player to initiate contact is Mauti\u2019s specialty.\nIf an opponent remembers Mauti\u2019s number after a hit and has second thoughts about touching the football for the rest of the game, Mauti\u2019s made a huge impact by his own standards.\n\u201cThe feeling of the hit. The feeling of delivering a blow, it\u2019s just \u2014 There\u2019s something about it,\u201d Mauti said.\nIt was the worst feeling of his playing career \u2014 laying on his back on the Beaver Stadium grass, staring up at a blue sky knowing it was happening all over again.\nMauti had torn an anterior cruciate ligament before, so he knew pretty quickly when his left leg buckled during the first quarter of the 2011 Eastern Illinois game that his left leg was shot before he even hit the ground.\nAfter sutting out the entire 2009 season concentrating on rehabilitating his right knee, Mauti came back with a vengeance in 2010. He finished fifth on the team with 57 tackles.\nAn expanded on-field role would have to wait, however, following the early season injury to his left knee last season.\nMauti got luckier the second time around. When he was injured in 2009, he contracted a nasty case of strep throat. He lost nearly 30 pounds and couldn\u2019t eat normally for weeks. Last fall, Mauti was able to stay relatively healthy except for the knee injury. He was able to concentrate on healing after his surgery and took a better approach to his rehab having gone through it just months before.\nThen-defensive coordinator Tom Bradley wanted to keep his star linebacker involved with day-to-day operations. So Mauti became an extra coach, going so far as to call the majority of the defenses in the TicketCity Bowl after Bradley was promoted to interim head coach.\nIt helped having counsel from former Nittany Lions such as Jerome Hayes, Brennan Coakley and Sean Lee - who had been in Mauti\u2019s situation, battling back from knee injuries.\nBeyond two major knee injuries, Mauti has racked up the bumps and bruises one would expect of a brute who plays every snap with reckless abandon, thriving on collisions.\nMauti appeared in 11 games in 2010 and wouldn\u2019t let a sprained ankle suffered against Iowa or a separated shoulder courtesy of Ohio State to keep him away from football.\nMauti learned over a tumultuous summer that he could take on an even greater role for a squad desperately in need of vocal leader.\nWhen the NCAA came down on Penn State with a four-year bowl ban to go along with a $60 million fine and serious scholarship reductions, Mauti and teammate Michael Zordich got together with a plan to combat the NCAA\u2019s harshest penalty.\nThe sanctions gave any Penn State player a free chance to transfer out of the program without giving up a year of eligibility. Some chose to do just that, and other college programs began contacting Penn State players, some even coming to campus on recruiting trips.\nMauti and Zordich took it personally. The duo made their way to Coach Bill O\u2019Brien after the NCAA penalties were announced, and the next day made a statement outside of the team\u2019s practice complex that Penn State players would stick together.\nFor the most part, the Nittany Lions have.\nMauti said he was honored to eulogize Joe Paterno at a memorial service following the longtime coach\u2019s death in January. Speaking last in a line of players, each representing a decade Paterno in which coached, Mauti took to the lectern in the Bryce Jordan Center with no notes and spoke from the heart.\nHe told the story of his initial recruitment. Mauti\u2019s family didn\u2019t expect him to commit on the spot to Paterno, but that\u2019s what happened. Mauti remembered Paterno giving him flack for getting kicked out of a drill for fighting as a freshman.\n\u201c\u2018Hey, your dad used to act like he was tough, too, trying to fight people all the time,\u2019\u201d Mauti said in his best high-pitched impression of Paterno.\nPat Fitzgerald\u2019s eyes are trained to watch football and immediately evaluate.\nWhen the Northwestern coach dissects an opposing team\u2019s defense, his eyes go to the linebackers first. Fitzgerald, himself a college football hall of famer who played the position, sees no weaknesses in Mauti\u2019s game.\nMauti won\u2019t dwell on his past. He won\u2019t allow the fear of being injured to creep into his mind.\nHe won\u2019t let the negative white noise, the criticism of his team or school by outside talking heads, distract him. Like he did this summer, when other coaches were on Penn State\u2019s campus, looking to lure Nittany Lion players way, Mauti will give them an earful.

Mauti said he would rather hit someone between the sidelines.\nHe\u2019ll throw himself into Northwestern players with explosive zeal. He\u2019ll get up off the pile of players and high step his way back to the Penn State sideline.\nMimicking his big-hit celebration at his seat in the Lasch Football Building, Mauti bounces both of his legs simultaneously so his knees come up above the table where he\u2019s sitting.\nMauti\u2019s presence is heavily requested these days. He does this interview, then he\u2019s got to get going.\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose, man,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just playing every play like it\u2019s my last.\n\u201cFor all I know it could be taken away on any play.", "orig_sample_length": 1905, "prompt_length": 1705, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "power to make sure his teammates stick together.\nHe\u2019ll do it all as a leader, not a victim.\nMauti has been a college student for just over a year.

If he had to choose between his two roles, he\u2019d choose football.\nThat\u2019s why Mauti wants to be the only Mauti on the football field as much as possible. He\u2019s a little jealous of his brother, who won\u2019t be on the field this year as he serves a two-game suspension for violating team rules.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m on the field and there\u2019s a situation I want to", "w_wm_output": "power to ensure no one leaves.\nHe\u2019ll always do his part, on the field or off, to make up for the inevitable loss that will happen one day.\nEven if he knows that one day, when the NFL calls, he may never step on the field again.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not out here, it\u2019s definitely going to be tough,\u201d Mauti said.\nHe\u2019ll settle for that until then.\nHe\u2019s ready for the chance to say goodbye.\nMichael Zordich and Michael Mauti walked away from center circle, dusted their hands off and smiled.\nThe two friends who had made Penn State famous with their tough stance on NCAA sanctions earlier this summer had finished their last public statement of the summer.\nTheir work was done.

The best part? Call minutes made via WiFi aren't deducted from your plan. That's right -- as long as you're within range of a wireless broadband network, you'll have unlimited calls. An added benefit to this is that you're almost guaranteed great signal strength when you're in a place with good WiFi coverage.

This donation was part of a project jointly initiated by the National Centre of Manuscripts and ProCredit Bank, in which the Bank bought a unique collection of ex librises from a private individual living in Thessaloniki, Greece.\nMany of the graphic images on the ex librises were the work of Georgian painters, so their donation to the National Centre of Manuscripts is a very important contribution to preserving the heritage of Georgian manuscripts. They carry additional information about the life and creative work of Georgia\u2019s artists and important public figures.\n\u201cFrom ProCredit Bank\u2019s side we are extremely delighted to have had the chance to support Georgia\u2019s culture and inheritance of manuscripts. It\u2019s extremely rewarding to have had the chance to hand over this unique and interesting collection of ex librises to the National Centre of Manuscripts; that we had the opportunity to obtain these very interesting examples of Georgian culture and history. By handing this collection today to the National Centre of Manuscripts we also, one more time, want to demonstrate our support for the development of Georgian culture. All in all I think it\u2019s a very promising beginning for a hopefully fruitful and long-lasting relationship with the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\n\u201cIn the National Centre of Manuscripts there are manuscripts, historical documents, archival materials and library collections. This is one of the largest collections across the country. It has been gathering material and growing since the 19th century; this process is still ongoing and will never be finished. The collection has mainly grown from people\u2019s donations, except for a few exceptions. Over the years we received donations from individuals, families, from private companies, public and private organizations. And the result is a unique collection which is now protected by the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d he added.\n\u201cToday, one of the priorities for us is searching for new materials and continuing the pursuit of our great ancestors, who began collecting such materials in the 19th century. We also have another sub-priority, as just like this material was found in a foreign country, great care is needed not to lose Georgia-related materials that may be located abroad. They shouldn\u2019t fall into someone else\u2019s hands, in some cases private collectors. Then the trace will be lost,\u201d Buba Kudava said.\n\u201cWe were searching over the internet with our colleagues for information of this sort, and we managed to connect with an individual in Thessaloniki, Greece. We asked them to send us information on a regular basis about Georgia-related materials. And indeed they sent us the ex libris collection and when we showed this material to experts, it turned out to be very interesting. There are many famous figures associated with these ex librises. On the one hand, one part of this collection was designed by well-known artists. The second part is known because it is created for famous statesmen, but by a lesser-known Georgian painter. The first is the Elene Akhvlediani ex libris, the second is the Sergo Kobuladze ex libris. We did not have a separate collection of ex librises until now. Of course there are", "baseline_completion": "such materials in archives and in books, but so far we have not had such an amount of ex librises,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEx librises were invented along with book printing and were an integral part of a book through the ages. Today, some of them are considered works of art. That is why participation in such a project is very important for ProCredit Bank, and we are very pleased that this unique ex libris collection has been added to the heritage of Georgian manuscripts,\u201d said Sascha Ternes, General Director of JSC ProCredit Bank.\nThe term \u201cex libris\u201d is Latin for \u201cfrom the library of\u201d, and is used to describe a printed label on the inside front cover of a book indicating the name of the owner. In the past, ex librises often took the form of a drawing, an emblem or an illustration of some famous event, sometimes by a famous artist.", "orig_sample_length": 963, "prompt_length": 763, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "some in the collection, but not in this quantity,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThe Georgian ex libris has not been studied in sufficient detail. It has been researched to a certain degree by historians, but there is still a lot to be done. We need to create an archive of Georgian ex libris, to collect them in one place, because there are quite a few of them in private collections abroad, which need to be protected. So, we decided to organize the donation, to create an archive of Georgian ex libris and to publish a book on this subject. We need to find the best way to organize this. The material will be studied by historians, as I mentioned earlier, and will be published as a book, as well as this collection will be added to the collection of the National Centre of Manuscripts,\u201d he concluded.", "w_wm_output": "some ex librises in the National Centre of Manuscripts library and archives.

{"idx": 129, "truncated_input": "\"Oh, you are stuck on homework problem number 13? I found a solution on YouTube. That helped a lot. Just Google it, you can find all the solutions.\"\nThe second problem is partially my fault. When I give an in-class assessment, I leave the solution out on the front desk so that students can check their answers when they are finished. Instead of studying this and figuring out their mistakes, students will usually just take a quick picture of the solutions using their phone. Of course they ask if it's OK to take a snapshot first, and I let them. However, the problem is that they think of the solution as something to collect rather than something to learn from.\nConfusion is the sweat of learning.\nYou can't just google a physics solution and expect to learn. Imagine if Luke Skywalker had access to the Internet on Dagobah. Here's what would have happened when his x-wing sunk beneath the water.\nYoda: So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Do you nothing that I say?\nLuke: Master moving stones around is one thing, but this is entirely different. But let me just Google \"how to lift an x-wing with the Force.\" Ah. Here it is.\nOf course that's not what happened (I would make this alternate scene into a comic if I could actually draw). Luke learned about the Force by failing. Yes, students learn physics by working on problems and by failing to solve problems. It's the journey to the solution that's important, not the solution itself. Using a video solution would be like using a golf cart to run 5 miles. Sure, you end up in the same place if you run or ride\u2014but they do not produce the same results.\nBut why do students think this? Why do they think learning is as simple as quick search or a photo with their smart phone? There are likely many reasons for students to hold these learning beliefs. However, I popular media often doesn't help. Remember this scene from The Avengers?\nSHIELD agent Maria Hill asks Tony Stark: \"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\" Stark's answer: \"Last night\". This shows that Tony Stark is so awesome he just figured astrophysics out last night. Clearly, students feel that you have to be a special superhero to understand astrophysics. You either get it in one night, or you'll never get it. I would prefer to have Stark say \"", "baseline_completion": "Well, I've been working in this field for 10 years and I'm just scratching the surface.\" Maybe that wouldn't fit too well in the movie.\nOr here's another good one from Days of Thunder.\nCole pulls up to the race track to test out a stock car.\nHarry Hogge: What do you know about stock car racing?\nCole Trickle: Well... watched it on television, of course.\nHarry Hogge: You've seen it on television?\nCole Trickle: ESPN. The coverage is excellent, you'd be surprised at how much you can pick up.\nHarry Hogge: I'm sure I would.\nSee. Learning is simple. You just need to watch some videos and you'll be all set\u2014except when you aren't. Nope. Learning is tough, but it's totally worth it.", "orig_sample_length": 746, "prompt_length": 546, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Last week\" or \"Last month\" or \"Last year\" instead of \"Last night\" in order to send the right message.\nThe same message is sent in the movie Brave. Merida learns how to shoot an arrow by watching a video. I don't know if she was watching a YouTube video, but it seemed likely. Merida makes the same mistake that students do when they look at a solution and think \"I can't learn this.\" In fact, Merida is too smart for the video. She's already figured out the math and physics behind the arrow, and she only needs to practice. In other words, she's already learned the important stuff, and she just needs to work on applying it.\nMany students think that learning is simply about the practice problem. If you get the right answer, then you've learned. However, this is not the case. Once you have the correct answer, you have to use your knowledge to", "w_wm_output": "Last year I took a class on it or studied it on my own.\" Or even better, that he just tried it and failed a bit along the way.\nI'm not sure how to fix the mindset of students today. Perhaps I don't want to. Perhaps I want to create a class where students want to learn for the sake of learning. I want there to be some value in learning and not just finishing a problem in order to move onto the next problem.\nThis is the sort of mindset that I want my students to adopt, and I want my students to adopt this sort of mindset in other spheres of their lives. When they are stuck on their homework problem, or they are unsure of how to perform a new physical task, I want them to say to themselves \"I can't just Google it\" but to say to themselves \"I wonder how I could figure this out.\" I want my students to say to themselves \"Tod", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.7580001354217529, 0.763227641582489,

{"idx": 130, "truncated_input": "These two healthcare REITs are trading for dirt-cheap valuations despite high dividends and a solid history of growth.\nInvesting in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, is one of the best ways to enjoy high dividends and the potential for capital growth. On a valuation basis, REITs specializing in healthcare properties are trading cheaply right now, and two seem to be a particularly good bargain: HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW).\nThis type of real estate should be an excellent long-term investment for three main reasons: demographics, increased healthcare spending, and market opportunity.\nDemographics indicate a growing demand for healthcare properties over the coming decades. Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification. This way, if one market faces headwinds (say, the U.S.), it won't represent virtually all of Medical Properties' assets.\nThe company does have a relatively high debt load for a REIT: Debt represents 51.6% of Medical Properties' assets, so there's added risk to consider. However, 98% of the portfolio's leases have annual rent increases built in, and the company's payout ratio is less than two-thirds of FFO -- lower than that of most peers.\nIn short, there's no reason to believe Medical Properties Trust will have any debt-related issues going forward, with a", "baseline_completion": "growing stream of income that's already more than enough to cover the dividend.\nNote: Share prices and guidance are current as of 5/23/16. Normalized or adjusted FFO guidance is used when available.\nNo stock with double-digit growth potential is without risk, and these two are certainly no exception. In fact, a higher level of perceived risk is responsible for the low valuations. Healthcare spending could slow, operating partners could face greater financial difficulties, or there could be a shortage of attractive acquisition opportunities in the target property types. Any one of these factors could cause these stocks to take a dive.\nHowever, I think the growth potential and the solid track record of delivering profits in a variety of economic climates more than make up for the risks. Either of these healthcare REITs would make a solid addition to a well-diversified dividend growth portfolio.", "orig_sample_length": 1174, "prompt_length": 974, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "7.2% dividend yield and an attractive dividend growth rate.\nBoth of these companies offer an attractive combination of high dividend yields, a history of dividend growth, and a solid growth outlook.

In fact, at an enterprise value to EBITDA multiple of 8.4x, Medical Properties Trust is relatively cheap, when you consider the high-quality growth profile of the business.\nIn terms of valuation, HCP looks even better, at an EV to EBITDA of just 7.7x.\nUltimately, HCP and Medical Properties Trust are both solid long-term healthcare REITs with excellent growth prospects. However, given that Medical Properties Trust is cheaper at the moment, I'd say this stock is the better buy right now.\nBeth McKenna has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Galvin has headlined the Lions\u2019 defensive unit from centre back this season, putting together a string of solid performances to contain rival sides to just 28 goals in their 19 games to date. Now, the 27-year-old is relishing the lead-up to a shot at grand final glory and says there\u2019s no reason why his team mates can\u2019t tough out another gritty win against the favoured Hawks. \u201cWe really toughed it out against Leeton last weekend but we\u2019ve been doing that all year,\u201d Galvin said. \u201cIt was a pretty scrappy win and we defended like our lives depended on it when they threw everything at us in the last few minutes.\u201d Having only just taken over the captaincy from the unavailable Duncan Cameron, Galvin is facing the unusual prospect of being one of the side\u2019s most senior players in just his second season at Hall Bros Oval. The defender also admitted his surprise at Young\u2019s run to the finals but credited the injection of youth into the side. \u201cWe were really in a building phase last year and we copped a few floggings with all those juniors blokes coming in,\u201d Galvin said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve kept that core group together for two years and I think we\u2019ve come along quicker than we anticipated. \u201cThat comes down to those younger boys in the side having an impact and guys like Alex Mitchell, who I\u2019d say is one of the fastest blokes in the competition, and Pat Hislop have been real standouts all year.\u201d All eyes are now fixed upon the task ahead - toppling the defending premiers. Galvin knows it\u2019s no easy task but says the result will be vastly different from their 6-0 loss to Henwood Park in July. \u201cWe were missing a few players from our back line that game, so I think that probably affected us a fair bit,\u201d Galvin said. \u201cStill, we know they\u2019ll be hard to get on top of and they\u2019ll throw everything at us in attack. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to hold them out and look to hit them through counterattack.\u201d While you\u2019re with us, did you know that The Daily Advertiser is now offering sports and local events as part of its growing email newsletter service?

{"idx": 133, "truncated_input": "It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, crumbling into something tiresome and tedious.\nWhere the science-fiction genre is concerned, it\u2019s not hard to at the very least appreciate the ambition of the storytelling. It takes an honest, extra layer of creativity to create a reality not bound by the restrictions of our own, and it can be a delight to watch a perfect mixture of detailed universe building mesh with smart, unique storytelling. Of course, this requires delicate balance, as a dip too far one way finds a convoluted mess, and a dip in the opposite direction creates something that ultimately feels hollow and incomplete. It is sadly the former trap to which Andy and Lana Wachowski\u2019s Jupiter Ascending falls victim.\nIn a similar vein to what they were able to accomplish with previous sci-fi stories like The Matrix and Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending is a narrative set in a vivid and comprehensive world. There are legions of soldiers who have had their DNA spliced with animals \u2013 like the wolf-infused Caine (Channing Tatum) or the bee-like Stinger (Sean Bean). There are galaxy-spanning businesses where worlds are held like long-term investments. There\u2019s even intergalactic low-level bureaucracy that has all varieties of individuals waiting in lines and shuffling from one department to the next. It\u2019s dense, interesting, weird and at times funny, but what it\u2019s all wrapped around is another \u201cChosen One\u201d story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, eventually crumbling into something tiresome and tedious \u2013 albeit consistently beautiful.\nThe Wachowskis do legitimately make good choices in the casting department, as both Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum make for fun, charismatic leads to take us through the story. Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, an illegal alien living with her Russian immigrant family and working as a housekeeper living in modern day Chicago. As we see happen oh so often at the cinema, however, her life changes in an instant when she meets Caine (Tatum), an intergalactic bounty hunter. Jupiter is not only made aware of life on other planets, but also that she is the genetic recurrence of one of the most powerful women in the galaxy, and stands to literally inherent the Earth now that she has passed away. It\u2019s a simple and rather familiar plot, but through a first act of enjoyable \u201cawakening\u201d material and sky-shredding action scenes, Jupiter Ascending holds its own.\nIt\u2019s with the introduction of the trio of central villains that everything begins to fall apart \u2013 which is a sincere problem considering that they wind up completely driving the entire story. These are the three surviving members of the Abrasax family -- Balem (Eddie Redmayne), Titus (Douglas Booth) and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) \u2013 and the sons and daughter of the woman whom Jupiter Jones is a genetic equal. Each of them has a personal desire to take control of the Earth \u2013 which is alternately described as being extremely valuable and just a single piece of a much larger business \u2013 but also each take their own place doing more harm to the movie than good. Kalique winds up being mostly useless to the story, simply providing huge amounts of exposition and then disappearing; Titus merely feels like a stall in the narrative, serving as what is really a fairly pointless obstacle; and Balem simply feels overcooked in every sense, with Redmayne giving a highly bizarre, scenery-chewing performance full of needless affectation that makes him stick out like a sore thumb (really making you wonder what kind of off-base directions he was being given by the Wachowskis). As Jupiter Ascending\u2019s plot encounters these characters, the film begins to degrade faster and faster, exploring needless and unnecessary elements of the sci-fi world that do more subtraction than addition.\nAt this point in their careers, Andy and Lana Wachowski have become better known for their visual flash and style, and it serves the movie well. Their flair is apparent from the costume and makeup work (the idea of DNA splicing works magic in this department) to the production design, and it all serves to provide Jupiter Ascending with a unique feel (even when it wears references to movies like Brazil on its sleeve). Immense credit also goes to the visual effects teams, who not only render some fantastic air battles and spaceships, but also expansive alien environments that do their", "baseline_completion": "part to make the audience feel like they\u2019re being taken to a different world. All of this spectacle doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that character motivations are at times completely dubious, and that the third act drags on far too long, but it does help.\nIt\u2019s hard to really begrudge a film like Jupiter Ascending, both for its creative scope and in that it is one of the few-and-far-between female-led action movies, but it is equally hard to validate it beyond those elements, it\u2019s aesthetics, and the casting of the leads. There is perhaps a better feature that exists partially on the cutting room floor \u2013 explaining some of the more bizarre plot developments/holes \u2013 or one that could have been made with just a few tweaks to the screenplay. But the movie that will be hitting theaters this week is best described as unfortunate.", "orig_sample_length": 1262, "prompt_length": 1062, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "best to provide a fully-realized world. On the downside, the film\u2019s pacing is far too slow to take advantage of any of this, and the visual grandeur that is just begging to be featured in a better movie.\nIn the end, it\u2019s a shame that Jupiter Ascending is a film that winds up being a lot less than the sum of its parts. The Wachowskis have a lot of fun playing around with the science-fiction genre and crafting a universe that is both detailed and entertaining, but they simply didn\u2019t have the storytelling chops to make it work. It\u2019s a shame to see a movie about the importance of one Earthling\u2019s existence being so mishandled.", "w_wm_output": "part to hold the eye and make Jupiter Ascending\u2019s world feel alive.\nUnfortunately, not even all those attributes can save Jupiter Ascending, which is almost entirely bogged down by an out of balance story that gets more and more muddled and convoluted as time goes on, eventually making it clear that the Wachowskis were working off of a much smaller, more nimble script than they are actually capable of executing. The result is a fun, ambitious sci-fi adventure that is bogged down by a tedious screenplay.\n[newwindow=\"https://www.homeshifting.ie/house-removals/house-removals-from-Dublin-to-Limerick/\"]House

{"idx": 134, "truncated_input": "For a career that once seemed so good on paper, the crisis in teacher recruitment is now hardly ever out of the news.\nThere are not enough people signing up to become teachers and too many are dropping out - some experienced due to the stress and increase in workload but often the newly qualified leave the profession, unprepared for the life in the classroom.\nSchool lead Andrew Truby, a national leader of education, is determined to change the narrative about teaching as a profession.\nHe feels school leaders have it in their gift to change this situation on the ground by making brave decisions and by investing in the professional culture so that schools become irresistible places to work.\nAt St Thomas of Canterbury School, in Meadowhead, where Mr Truby is executive headteacher, there is a 100 per cent school-based teacher training school which is going from strength-to-strength.\nThe outstanding Ofsted-rated school became a teaching school in 2015, and works with partner schools in the Learning Unlimited Teaching School Alliance.\nThe alliance, based in a modern training facility at the school, takes on School Direct trainees on a year-long programme.\nEach student is placed in one of 14 partner schools across Sheffield, Doncaster and Chesterfield for the entire programme, where they will work for a year alongside outstanding and primary class teachers.\nTeaching school manager, Anita Bray, said: \"The beauty of this course is that trainee teachers are based in a school for the whole programme.\n\"They encounter children and liaise with parents. They do things like parents evening - all the nitty gritty.\n\"The trainee teachers have been there and have done it, they have had that experience which is much different from doing it in classrooms.\"\nDuring the course, students spend time in another of the partner schools so they get to experience life in two schools.\nThey are given a mentor who, at first, they observe, then plan lessons alongside before the mentor oversees the trainee teacher planning and delivering the lessons.\nThe trainee teachers meet once a week at the School Direct hub session for training, with specialist leaders of education or subject specialists coming in to take sessions.\nTeaching school director, Sarah Rockliff, described the process as 'learning by doing'.\nShe said: \"Trainee teachers are in classrooms and they are coming to hub sessions and picking up ideas about teaching and learning and then the next day they get the chance to put that into practice.\n\"Teaching is a craft and the only way to become a master of your craft is to keep practising it.\"\nShe added: \"After only a few weeks the trainees start to refer to their partner school as 'my school' and they feel a real connection to the school they are working in and are invested in the children. That adds to the motivation.\n\"It's a hard course and requires a lot of hard work.\"\nThe alliance was established in 2015 and the first cohort of students all gained jobs after completing the course.\nTrainees come from a variety of backgrounds, some have been teaching assistants or involved in education, while others are looking for a career change.\nTrainee teacher Nick Walker, aged 31, taught English abroad before returning to England to further his career.\nHe said: \"I have been teaching for five years already and I thought it would be beneficial to me to be in a hands-on situation and seeing what it was like day-today.\n\"I was at university 10 years ago. I wanted to carry on learning and this feels like a job whereas if I'd gone back to university it would have felt like a step backwards.\"\nFormer secondary school teaching assistant Kirsty Norris, 25, said: \"You see the reality of life in a school. You experience parents' evening and when sometimes your lessons plans just don't work.\n\"It's hard work but you know that next year it will all be worth it.\"\nMr Truby, who is strategic lead for the alliance, said recruiting teachers ready for the classroom had been a challenge in the past.\n\"Recruitment of high quality teachers is an ongoing challenge for schools and in the past the newly qualified teachers who we did appoint were not ready for the classroom,\" he said.\n\"Through our 100 per cent school-based teacher training route, our School Direct trainee teachers experience the full school year in a primary school.\n\"When", "baseline_completion": "they start in their NQT year, they are confident in subject knowledge, planning, marking, assessment as well as knowing how the school works throughout the year.\"\nHe felt the perception around teaching needed to change because it is 'the best job in the world'.\nHe added: \"Although teaching as a career gets a really bad press and there is a lot of talk about workload, we believe that the schools who invest in their culture will have an easier job recruiting and retaining the best teachers.\n\"We spend time making our schools a positive place to work because happier teachers mean happier children.\n\"It is time to change the narrative about this profession because we believe that teaching is the best job in the world.\"\nThe alliance is still recruiting trainees for September when it will start two new programmes. In addition to general primary, there will be a primary with maths and an early years route.", "orig_sample_length": 1212, "prompt_length": 1012, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "they successfully complete the training year they have not only completed the training year but have also had the full school year in a classroom with an experienced teacher to support them.\n\"They

Christensen has been a supporter of family planning since high school, when she stuffed envelopes as a volunteer at a Planned Parenthood affiliate in California. Now a Tucson resident, she continues to advocate for reproductive rights and sexual health.\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona serves more than 100,000 families every year; maybe your family is one of them.\nTucson is home to the Margaret Sanger Health Center, namesake of Planned Parenthood's founder. A century ago, Margaret Sanger was a New York City nurse who witnessed the horrors of women dying prematurely after having too many children, while others died from botched abortions. This experience motivated her to become an activist for the availability and legality of contraception. Sanger was a controversial figure\u2014and that controversy lingers to this day.\nSanger first visited Tucson in the 1930s, when she helped set up the Tucson Mother's Health Clinic (also called Clinica Para las Madres), Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona's precursor. Sanger, bedeviled by health problems, was drawn by Tucson's climate. Her husband was drawn by Arizona's lack of income tax, and in 1933, they purchased an adobe house in the foothills.\nIn the early '40s, Sanger and her husband moved closer to the city's heart, as gasoline rations dulled suburbia's attractiveness. They moved into a house on Elm Street, just east of the Arizona Inn. Before his death, her husband obtained an empty lot on Sierra Vista Drive, a stone's throw from their Elm Street residence. Sanger's son Stuart built a house on one side, and Sanger decided to build her dream home on the other.\nSanger's homes hosted lavish parties as well as fundraisers for organizations like Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona and the Tucson Medical Center (of which she was also a co-founder). She took up hobbies such as cooking and watercolor; today, many of her original paintings adorn the walls of Planned Parenthood administrative headquarters in Tucson, the building that was named in her honor.\nPlanned Parenthood, in Arizona and nationwide, is currently under attack. Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to do away with Title X, a national program providing preventive health care to low-income patients; the fate of Title X is now in the Senate's hands. Since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed it into law, it has helped millions of women access services such as contraception, preventing an estimated 973,000 unintended pregnancies and 406,000 abortions every year.\nRep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), meanwhile, seeks to interfere with services covered by private insurance. By cutting off federal funds for insurance companies that cover abortions\u2014even when the tax dollars aren't put toward abortion coverage\u2014his bill would deny women the legal right to an abortion, guaranteed by the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. It would also impose tax penalties on those whose insurance offers such coverage.\nIn Arizona, families are facing further potential threats as the Republican-controlled Legislature introduced several anti-women's-health initiatives this year. HB 2384 would make Planned Parenthood newly ineligible for the Arizona Working Poor Tax Credit. HB 2416 would cause additional obstacles to abortion access, including changing the definition of \"surgical abortion\" to", "baseline_completion": "include abortion by pill, which could cut off rural women from abortion services. HB 2443 would infringe upon patient privacy by denying care to women who refuse to disclose the reasons behind their decision to abort.\nA century ago, Margaret Sanger witnessed tragedies that resulted from unintended pregnancies. In response, she illegally smuggled diaphragms into the country and opened family-planning clinics in defiance of the law\u2014and spent time in jail for her troubles.

{"idx": 138, "truncated_input": "The Las Vegas real estate market got a small reprieve in February; with sales volume at a four-year high for the month and a dip in foreclosure resales helping prices increase slightly from January. A total of 3,698 new and existing houses and condos were sold in the Las Vegas-Paradise metro area in February, according to MDA DataQuick. That\u2019s up 9.8% from January and 10.5% from one year ago. A 5.7% increase from January to February is the average, dating back to 1994, DataQuick said. The February 2010 total was the highest for the month since 2006, when 6,065 homes were sold, but 2% below the 16-year average February sales total. It\u2019s the 18th straight month that total sales rose year-over-year. Existing home sales totaled 3,311, up 7.1% from January and up 9.5% from last year. It\u2019s the highest total for February existing sales since 2005. Existing home sales are on a 22-month-long run of monthly year-over-year increases. Foreclosure resales accounted for 59.6% of all resales in February, down from 62% in January and down from 70.6% last year. After peaking in April 2009 at 73.7%, foreclosure resales have declined every month. While foreclosure resales were down, foreclosure proceedings were up. In February, 1,756 homes and condos were foreclosed on in Las Vegas, up 5.3% from January, but down 52.8% from 3,718 foreclosures last year. New home sales totaled 387 in February, up 40% from January and up 20.2% from last year, but it was one of the slowest February sales totals in DataQuick\u2019s 16 years of records, second only to last year. The decline in foreclosure resales and the increase in new home sales helped the median price increase from January, but only slightly. The median price paid for all new and resale houses and condos sold in the Las Vegas metro area in February was $126,197, up 0.4% from $125,750 in January but down 17.2% from $152,500 a year earlier. DataQuick said the year-over-year decline was the smallest since March 2008, when the median dropped 16% from a year earlier, to $247,925. In addition, sales of homes over $200,000 made up 22.4% of total sales, up from 21.3% in January but down from 30.8% a year earlier. The median sales price is on a 34-month-long run of monthly year-over-year declines and in February 2010, was 59.6% below the peak median of $312,000 in November 2006. The median price for single-family homes was $133,800 in February, down from $135,000 in January and down from $157,000 last year. The median condo sales price was $69,000, even from January, but down 9.2% from $76,000 last year.

DataQuick defines cash borrowers as those purchases where there was no indication of a purchase mortgage recorded at the time of sale, but can include those that used alternative financing arrangements and in some cases borrowers might be taking out mortgages after their purchases. Absentee buyers, usually investors, but anyone who indicates at the time of sale that the property tax bill will go to a different address, accounted for 44.6% of all Las Vegas area home sales. However, house flipping declined. Homes sold in February that had previously sold in the past three weeks to six months accounted for 3.7% of all sales, down from 5% in January, but up from 2.6% last year.

He was batting .299 this year with 7 homers and 43 RBI.\nThroughout the last couple of seasons, Jesse Winker dealt with pain his right shoulder.\nAfter he felt more pain Monday, it was determined that Winker would need surgery to repair his shoulder. He will miss the remainder of the season.\nThe Reds placed Winker on the 10-day disabled list Thursday with a right shoulder subluxation.\n\"Man, I have no idea it is,\" said Winker. \"I know my shoulder hurts. That\u2019s all I know.\"\nWinker said the pain was \"off and on\" all season but Monday was essentially the final straw.\nOn first base during a comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Winker ducked under a line-drive single from Tucker Barnhart in the ninth inning and fell to the ground on the base paths. Winker later scored the game-winning run.\nA potential Rookie of the Year candidate, Winker was batting .299 this season with seven homers and 43 RBI. The outfielder ranked fourth in the Majors with a .405 on-base percentage. He had more walks (49) than strikeouts (46).\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Winker was emotional about the end of his season.\n\"Obviously, I was hoping that surgery wasn\u2019t the end result but I\u2019ve been dealing with this for 2-3 years,\" Winker said. \"Just got to the point now where it\u2019s time to go fix it.\"\nIt's a tough loss for the Reds' lineup, which was already without outfielder Scott Schebler. On the DL, Schebler began a rehab assignment Wednesday, going 1-for-3 with a walk as a designated hitter at Triple-A Louisville.\nWinker, based on what he's been told from doctors, said his goal is to return by Feb. 1, 2019. He said he felt the pain when he completed \"any baseball move.\"\n\"There were times where it affected his swing,\" Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman said. \"He altered his swing path because of the pain. That\u2019s a tough way to play at the Major League level. He did a heck of a job. I don\u2019t think anybody realized that he was going through it as much as he was.\"\nMason Williams, an outfielder at Louisville, was called up to fill Winker\u2019s roster spot. Williams played in 25 games with the New York Yankees over the past three seasons.\nA left-handed hitter, Williams signed with the Reds as a minor league free agent last offseason.\nWilliams was batting .280 with six homers and 30 RBI in 87 games at Louisville. He recorded a hit in 13 of his last 14 games.\n\"It\u2019s been a matter of me being healthy and staying on the field and playing my game and just having confidence in myself,\" Williams said.\nWilliams, once considered the Yankees' top prospect, learned of his promotion to the big leagues Thursday morning.\nHe played on the same high school team in Florida as Cardinals pitcher Austin Gomber, who", "baseline_completion": "had a no-hitter against the Reds for six innings Tuesday. The two players will sometimes train together in the offseason.\nTo make room on the 40-man roster for Williams, the Reds moved injured infielder Alex Blandino (torn ACL in his right knee) to the 60-day DL.\n\"He\u2019s had productive at-bats, competitive at-bats, against both left-and-right-handed pitching,\" Riggleman said of Williams. \"He\u2019s a good athlete. We\u2019re confident he will come up here and do a good job.\"\nSCHEBLER STILL PROGRESSING: Schebler was in Louisville's lineup as a designated hitter for his second rehab game Thursday.\nBut the key to his return will be when he's comfortable making throws.", "orig_sample_length": 990, "prompt_length": 790, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "was making his first career start Thursday.\nWilliams joined the Reds after spending the last two seasons in the Yankees organization.\n\"I was 20 years old, a first-round draft pick and I was playing baseball with guys I looked up to,\" Williams said. \"It was a lot of fun.

{"idx": 140, "truncated_input": "Rafael Nadal became the first man to win eight titles at the same Grand Slam tournament after beating fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in the French Open final on Sunday.\nIf Rafael Nadal truly was going to be challenged, if his bid for an unprecedented eighth French Open championship would be slowed even a bit, this might have been the moment.\nLeading by a set and a break 70 minutes into Sunday's final against David Ferrer, another generally indefatigable Spaniard, Nadal faced four break points in one game. The last was a 31-stroke exchange, the match's longest, capped when Nadal absorbed Ferrer's strong backhand approach and transformed it into a cross-court backhand passing shot.\nFerrer glared at the ball as it flew past and landed in a corner, then smiled ruefully. What else was there to do? Dealing with Nadal's defence-to-offence on red clay is a thankless task. His rain-soaked 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Ferrer on was Nadal's record 59th win in 60 matches at the French Open and made him the only man with eight titles at any Grand Slam tournament.\n\"I never like to compare years, but it's true that this year means something very special for me,\" Nadal said, alluding to the way he managed to come back from a left knee injury that sidelined him for about seven months.\n\"When you have a period of time like I had,\" he added, \"you realize that you don't know if you will have the chance to be back here with this trophy another time.\"\nBut he does it, year after year.\nHe won four French Opens in a row from 2005-08, and another four in a row from 2010-13.\n\"Rafael was better than me,\" said Ferrer, who had won all 18 sets he'd played the past two weeks to reach his first Grand Slam final at age 31. \"He didn't make mistakes.\"\nA week past his 27th birthday, Nadal now owns 12 major trophies in all \u2014 including two from Wimbledon, one each from the U.S. Open and Australian Open \u2014 to eclipse Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver and equal Roy Emerson for the third-most in history. Nadal trails only Roger Federer's 17 and Pete Sampras' 14.\n\"Winning 17 Grand Slam titles, that's miles away,\" Nadal said with his typical humility. \"I'm not even thinking about it.\"\nThis was Nadal's first major tournament after a surprising second-round loss at Wimbledon last June. Since rejoining the tour in February, he is 43-2 with seven titles and two runner-up finishes. He's won his past 22 matches.\n\"For me, it's incredible,\" said Toni Nadal, Rafael's uncle and coach. \"When I think of all that Rafael has done, I don't understand it.\"\nLet's be plain: No one, perhaps not even Ferrer himself, expected Nadal to lose Sunday.\nThat's because of Nadal's skill on clay, in general, and at Roland Garros, in particular, but also because of how Ferrer had fared against his friend and countryman \u2014 and video-game competitor \u2014 in the past.\nFerrer entered Sunday 4-19 against Nadal. On clay, Nadal had 16 consecutive victories over Ferrer, whose only head-to-head win on the surface came the first time they played, in July 2004, when Nadal was 18.\nNadal had yet to make his French Open debut then, missing it that year because of a broken left foot. On May 23, 2005, Nadal played his first match at Roland Garros, beating Lars Burgsmuller 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-1 on Court 1, known as the \"bullring\" because of its oval shape.\nAnd so began the reign.\nNadal won a record 31 consecutive matches at the French Open until the fourth round in 2009, when Robin Soderling beat him. In 2010, Nadal started a new streak, which currently stands at 28.\nThere was occasional shakiness this year. Nadal lost the first set of each of his first two matches, and was pushed to a tiebreaker to begin his third. His fourth match, a straight-set win against No. 15 Kei Nishikori, \"was a major step forward,\" Nadal said. Still, he barely edged No. 1-ranked Novak Djokovic in a thrilling semifinal that lasted more than 4 1/2 hours and ended 9-7 in the fifth set Friday.\nBy any measure, that match was far more enjoyable to take in than the final, akin to dining on a filet mignon accompanied by a well-aged bottle of Bordeaux \u2014 each bite and sip rich, textured \u2014 one day, then grabbing a hot dog and can of soda from a street vendor 48 hours later.\nUnder a leaden sky that eventually would release a steady shower from the second set on, Ferrer felt nerves at the outset, he acknowledged later. But after the players traded early breaks, Ferrer held for a 3-2 lead.\nThat's when Nadal took over, winning seven games in a row and 12 of 14 to render the ultimate result pretty clear. It was as if he simply decided, \"Enough is enough.\" His court coverage was impeccable, as usual, showing no signs of any problems from that left knee, which was supported by a band of white tape. His lefty forehand whips were really on-target, accounting for 19 of his 35 winners and repeatedly forcing errors from Ferrer.\nWhen Nadal did have lapses, he admonished himself, once slapping his forehead with his right palm after pushing a lob wide. But what's demoralizing for opponents is the way Nadal slams the door when they have openings, then rushes through when he gets the slightest chance.\nHe was at his relentless best on key points, including those four break chances for Ferrer at 3-1 in the second set. Immediately after, Nadal broke to 5-1 on a forehand winner down the line.\nAs Nadal prepared to serve in the next game, a man wearing a white mask and carrying a fiery flare jumped out of the stands nearby. The intruder quickly was shoved to the ground by one security guard, while another went to protect Nadal.\n\"I felt a little bit scared at the first moment,\" Nadal said, \"because I didn't see what's going on.\"\nIt happened within a few minutes of other actions by protesters, including chanting from the upper deck that briefly delayed play. Police said seven people were held for questioning.\nNadal got broken in that game, then broke back right away to take the second set.\nThe third set was similar to the first. It was 3-all, then suddenly over. Nadal took the last three games, ending the match with a forehand winner before dropping his racket", "baseline_completion": "and falling on his back, leaving a rust-colored smudge on his white shirt and flecks of clay on his stubbled cheeks. Soon he was standing, holding his index finger aloft.\nYes, Nadal is No. 1 at the French Open, without a doubt. When the ATP rankings are issued Monday, however, he will be No. 5, due to points he dropped while hurt. Oddly enough, Ferrer will be at No. 4.\n\"Yeah, it's strange, no? I lost the final against Rafael, but tomorrow I am going to be No. 4 and him No. 5,\" Ferrer said with a grin, then delivered his punchline: \"I prefer to win here and to stay No. 5.\"\nSorry, David.

He then took off his cap and, almost in tears, lifted both arms high above his head in celebration as he walked toward the stands to soak in the cheers of thousands of fans.\nHe then accepted the trophy from French President Francois Hollande, choking up as he tried to sum up his feelings.\n\"It's true that I never dreamed of this,\" Nadal said. \"I'm very lucky and I want to thank everybody who helped me to reach this moment.\"\nFerrer, the No. 6-seeded Spaniard, was trying to become the first man since 1996 to take home the trophy from his home country. He had lost his first six finals at major tournaments.\nThis was his first trip to a final at any Grand Slam event; he first reached the semifinals in 2010.\nFerrer, who turns 3",

Atlantic Ave. would be the first oceanfront condo project to be built in Southeast Volusia in six years.\nSt. Petersburg-based Eckall Development says it already has two reservations for condo units at Waterford.\nThe city\u2019s planning board on Monday will consider a new site plan for the seven-story building that developers hope to begin building by the end of the year.\nCondo demand in New Smyrna Beach is on the rise.\nFrom March through June, condo sales rose 34 percent to 205 this year from 153 last year, according to the New Smyrna Beach Board of Realtors. The median sale price in June was $189,000, up 6 percent from $139,000 a year ago, but slightly down from $212,500 in April, the highest level in 1.5 years.\nA declining inventory is also fueling a rise in prices. The number of condos for sale in Southeast Volusia fell 22 percent to 462 in June, the lowest level in at least 4-1/2 years, from 594 a year ago.\nA Winter Park developer started building the proposed nine-story, 19-unit Vizcaya condo project in 2007, but abandoned the project the following year.\nThat left a development site where 193 pilings had already been pounded into the earth, a slab poured and blocks laid for the first-floor walls. The property has remained in that state ever since.\nEckall Development bought the property in December for $1.1 million, according to Volusia County property records. The existing infrastructure was tested and is sound, said Lee Allen, a company principal.\nAllen and Ken Eckelkamp, the founders of Eckall Development, say they are already familiar with Southeast Volusia having previously worked for JMC Communities, which built the 310-unit Minorca condo complex at the north tip of New Smyrna Beach between 2002 and 2007 and the 39-unit Seacrest condo complex in 2007 at 4071 S. Atlantic Ave. in New Smyrna Beach.\nThe last oceanfront condo started in the city was The Wave in 2", "baseline_completion": "007 at 2801 Hill St. The project was only 80 percent completed in 2008 when it was foreclosed and abandoned. Houston-based Silvestri Investments, which owns the Oceanwalk Condominiums in New Smyrna Beach, bought The Wave in late 2009, completed construction and has sold 10 of the 11 units.\nEckall Development needs to sell at least 11 units at Waterford before it can start construction, Allen said.\nThe company is offering six floor plans, including two penthouse units, each three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The units range in size from 1,845 square feet to 3,088 for a penthouse.\nPrices currently range from $700,000 to $1.6 million, but are expected to rise once construction starts, Collado said.", "orig_sample_length": 918, "prompt_length": 718, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "012.\nThe Waterford development will have a two-story parking garage with 50 parking spaces. It will have two elevators, with one reserved for residents and the other for guests. It will also have a community pool and beach access.\nMost of the units will have two bedrooms and two bathrooms.\nThe smallest unit will be 998 square feet, while the largest will be 1,500 square feet.\nThe units will range in price from $450,000 to $625,000, Allen said.\nHe said the development will be marketed to retirees and second homeowners.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for true buyers, not flippers,\u201d said Allen, whose company has developed 31 communities in Florida and 13 in Canada.\nBlock walls have been installed, while crews have poured concrete for the sl", "w_wm_output": "010.\n\u201cThere is pent-up demand for oceanfront,\u201d Eckelkamp said.\nEckall Development has been developing oceanfront projects in communities in Florida and South Carolina, including a 13-story, 199-unit oceanfront condo project at 345 S. Ocean Blvd., in Myrtle Beach, along with a 13-story, 20-unit oceanfront condo project under development at 326 S. Ocean Blvd., in Surfside Beach, S.C.\nAllen said Eckall Development is seeking a contractor and construction manager for Waterford. He declined to say when construction will start.\nThe planned 13,200-square-foot building would have five units on the ground floor and four on the second floor, with two units starting on the third

Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions and help yourself stay focused by implementing self-help techniques and maintaining a positive, nonjudgmental attitude.\nMentally tough athletes push through and overcome obstacles to stay focused on their ultimate goal. Developing the traits that characterize mental toughness can help you remain focused during running. According to sports psychologist JoAnn Dahlkoetter in an article for the online runner's resource, \"Competitor,\" several characteristics or traits tare commonly identified in mentally tough runners: Resilience, focus, strength, preparation, vision, openness and trust. You simply do not allow yourself to become distracted by external conditions or internal emotions -- you have the ability to put these distractions behind you for the time being and live in the moment.\nPositive self-talk can encourage you and help you stay focused while running. According to sports psychologists Leif Smith and Todd Kays in \"Sports Psychology for Dummies,\" mentally repeating specific cue words, such as \"focus\" or \"hustle,\" may help to increase your concentration when you feel a decrease in your level of focus. Tape the cue words to a piece of athletic tape around your wrist and mentally concentrate on them while you run, as though the words are your mantra. Don't beat yourself up if you're having an off day. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a good friend. Be positive and encouraging and tell yourself that you can do it.\nWhen you feel yourself starting to tire or slow down, marathon runner and trainer Jeff Galloway suggests practicing the following drill, adapted from his book, \"Mental Training for Runners: How to Stay Motivated.\" Tell yourself that you're going to continue running for just one minute more, reducing your pace slightly for a few seconds, then continue this pattern, telling yourself \"one more minute\" or \"10 more steps\"", "baseline_completion": "until you achieve your goal for the day. If you break down your goal into small chunks, it may seem more manageable and achievable and you'll be less likely to lose focus.\nAlmost all athletes use some form of visualization prior to or during their workout or competition to help them stay focused. According to Galloway, worrying and focusing on the negative possibilities is a major way that many runners become distracted and lose motivation. Visualization can help you overcome your worries and direct your focus back to your goal. Visualization involves vividly imagining and rehearsing positive outcomes to future events or the event in which you're currently involved. Before your race, you might lie down and imagine yourself running effortlessly, overcoming obstacles and achieving your goal. The more vividly you can imagine the scene by involving all of your five senses, the more effective your visualization will be.", "orig_sample_length": 687, "prompt_length": 487, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "after each pace reduction. The goal is to make the pace seem easier by reducing it ever so slightly.\nAnother technique from Galloway is to practice mentally pace your run. Just after you've passed a mile marker, tell yourself that you're going to run at this pace until you pass the next mile marker. Pay attention to the time as you run. When you reach the next mile marker, you will have the knowledge you need to speed up or slow down to maintain the same pace. Mentally pace your run the same way you would pace yourself physically during a race.\nAll runners experience mental lapses. When that happens, take a moment to evaluate your emotional state and mentally get back on track. Midway through a race, you may feel tired, bored or frustrated with the conditions. You may have thoughts of quitting. When this happens, pull yourself out of the negative mindset and change the way you", "w_wm_output": "until you're able to run once again at your usual pace.\nGalloway's tip for mental toughness is to practice meditation. Sit in a quiet place, close your eyes and focus on your breath. When you notice your mind has wandered, simply refocus your attention on your breathing. Sit in silence for five or 10 minutes every day for a week. Continue for one week every 10 days. As you practice meditation, your mind will become more and more focused.\nFitness guru and Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who received 13 gold medals from the U.S. Olympic team during her career, suggests that you choose to run with a positive attitude. When you are feeling frustrated or angry during your run, she suggests you simply allow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling and then run again at a slower speed.

{"idx": 151, "truncated_input": "Amazingly, half of all Americans say they don\u2019t care about government surveillance \u2014 and during a random sampling of people on the streets of New York City not one could identify Edward Snowden, or what he did.\nThat\u2019s despite an Academy Award winning documentary on his release of classified documents about the spying activities of a National Security Agency called Citizenfour.\nThe government is collecting data from you all the time. From your phone, computer, tablet, credit cards, travel records and more. We know they are doing this because of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nJohn Oliver traveled to Moscow where Snowden, wanted by the U.S government, has asylum for the next three years. There he interviewed Snowden in an attempt to find out why more Americans don\u2019t care about the government spying on their personal lives.\nBased on Snowden\u2019s explanation of the government\u2019s spying activities, here are five basic questions every American should ask themselves about the NSA surveillance program.\n1. Do you want the government to collect your data (including your naked pictures)?\nAccording to Oliver, Pew Research found that 46 percent of Americans say they don\u2019t care about government surveillance. Why? It\u2019s too complicated and technical to try to trace the life cycle of a text message. Hilariously Oliver tries to put the issue into terms Americans will care about \u2014 whether or not the government has access to your naked pictures. Once everyday folks heard the argument in those terms, they got interested in the debate pretty fast.\n\u201cI did this [released secret NSA spying information] to give the American people the chance to decide for themselves what kind of government they want to have,\u201d Snowden tells Oliver.\nDo you want a government that hoards your most scandalous communications?\n2. Why did the government lie about its spying activity?\nOn June 1, 2015, key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire, including the controversial Section 215 provision, which has been interpreted by a FISA Court to mean that the government has the authority to collect comprehensive data on its citizens.\nPrior to the Snowden revelations about programs like PRISM, American government officials \u2014 including President Obama \u2014 said the government was collecting only basic phone and internet records, like when a call was made and to whom (metadata), rather than the actual content of the conversation. Snowden proved that\u2019s just not true.\nThe Snowden documents showed that the government was collecting and storing the content of Americans\u2019 communications too, like emails, phone calls, internet searches and text and chat messages, rather than just basic call record information.\nWorse yet, it\u2019s not just being looked at; it\u2019s being stored in monster government data centers in Utah, in case it needs to be looked at in the future. So if you want to play a semantics game, they aren\u2019t actively looking at it, just saving a copy in case they need to later. Does that make you feel any better about it?\n3. Can you trust the government with this kind of power?\nMobile phone data provides an incredibly detailed account of your life \u2014 your location, who you call, emails, text messages, internet searches, online shopping habits. Combine that level of detailed data contained in your credit card records, home and work emails and internet searches, and that\u2019s a pretty freaky accurate representation of who you are, where you\u2019ve been, with whom and what you were doing. But not totally accurate.\nYour phone data might put you in a mall food court at the same time as a terrorist, but does that mean you\u2019re a terrorist too? What if you just both happen to love Orange Julius and soft pretzels?\nNow, imagine in the future the government charges you with a crime. Any crime, really. Doesn\u2019t matter which. For belonging to the wrong religion. For being too friendly with someone the government doesn\u2019t like. Happens all the time around the world. Rather than the government having to collect evidence about your crime to prove your guilt, it\u2019ll already have a pile of information on you it can use however it chooses. No warrant. Nada.\nWe might be cool with all of this surveillance capability being used against the terrorists, but what if it\u2019s turned on Americans one day?\nSo do you trust them?\n4. How do we balance privacy and safety?\nThe Patriot Act was conceived amidst the fear following the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. But even one of the primary authors of the Patriot Act, Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, testified that the legislation was never intended to authorize the bulk collection and storage of the communications of U.S. citizens and that its powers should be reined in when the Patriot Act is reauthorized this summer.\nGovernment officials argue that this kind of surveillance is critical for fighting terrorists and those who would do America and Americans harm. That sounds totally reasonable and fair. But with programs like PRISM and other surveillance activity Americans have no idea is going on, how can we have a debate and balance the idea of security against the idea of liberty?\nHow much privacy are we willing to give up for less security risk?\n5. Are you on a watch list?\nAt the end of the interview, Snowden gives John Oliver a pretty ominous warning \u2014 that by interviewing him, Oliver is likely now on a very serious, very scary U.S. government watch list. The idea of a watch list is discussed in more frightening detail in the Academy Award-winning documentary about Snowden, Citizenfour.\nAmericans are put on watch lists all the time, which brings increased scrutiny of communications, increased surveillance and, when traveling out of the", "baseline_completion": "country, often problems getting your passport cleared across international borders without intense questioning.

How would we know? It\u2019s a secret.\nThe principles of transparency and checks and balances the U.S. government is founded on demand that citizens be informed about these kinds of government activities. Whether you view Snowden as a hero or a traitor, as he says, now you know what your government is doing in our name. Do you care? Does it bother you? We should be allowed to have this debate and make an informed decision one way or the other.\nIn the meantime, John Oliver and his team of brillant writers have distilled the argument down to this: Do you want the government to have a picture of you naked?", "orig_sample_length": 1494, "prompt_length": 1294, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "country, increased risk of being abducted by the government to be interrogated.\nNow, you could argue that being on a watch list is a good thing.

{"idx": 155, "truncated_input": "New York\u2019s bike share really does attract way more commuters than tourists.\nSince its debut last year, New York City\u2019s bike share system, Citi Bike, has been wildly popular. In its first six months of operation, the bright blue bikes logged more than 5 million trips. The system has nearly 100,000 annual members. Yet Citi Bike\u2013which unlike most bike shares in major cities, isn\u2019t subsidized by public funds\u2013is losing money. One of the main reasons is that while annual memberships are popular, the much more profitable day passes aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a phenomenon easily seen in this visualization of two days of Citi Bike rides around New York City.\nDesigner Jeff Ferzoco, Sarah Kaufman at New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation and Juan Francisco Saldarriaga of Columbia University\u2019s Spatial Information Design Lab worked together to visualize Citi Bike journey data from September 17 and 18 of last year. Over those two days, when the weather was in the 60s and there was no rain, Citi Bike saw 75,000 rides. Rides are separated by type of membership, either annual (blue) or casual (yellow).\nThe visualization doesn\u2019t show exact routes along the city\u2019s grid, but instead approximates trips by tracing straight lines between the endpoints. Ridership picks up early in the morning, around 5:30 a.m., and is heavy between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Almost all of those riders are annual members. Yellow dots are barely visible on the map, except a few around the very lower tip of Manhattan and", "baseline_completion": "up near Central Park. As the day wears on, there\u2019s a slight increase in casual members\u2013people riding over the Brooklyn Bridge, for instance\u2013but for the most part, the vast majority of the map is the blue. During the evening rush hours, when commuters get back on a Citi Bike to go home, the map is overwhelmed by a dense network of blue.\nInterestingly, more riders seem to take Citi Bike during the evening hours than take it to work. The number of active riders hits 800 at 8:30 a.m., but spikes to more than 1,000 at 6 p.m.\nThough the balance of ridership clearly tips in favor of annual membership, it would be interesting to compare this data to a weekend.

In fact, just 15% of the riders are casual.\nBy 10 a.m., the daily commute is well underway, and with it, a huge spike in casual riders. By 10 a.m., more orange dots can be seen around the bike share docking stations, as commuters head to work. The lines are so thick that the bike share stops can be seen as a grid on the map. This creates a stark contrast with the early morning time period, where the annual members dominate.\nAs the day goes on, those lines thin out as commuters return home. But even as commuters go home, the lines thicken again, as casual riders take bikes from one station to another to explore the city.", "w_wm_output": "Williamsburg.\nIn fact, only a handful of yellow dots are scattered around the city. Overall, only a small fraction of trips are made by casual, non-membership riders.\nFerzoco, Kaufman, and Saldarriaga used the data to create a map showing the average distance ridden in each of five city districts.\nThe map shows a more skewed population of riders in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. Even in these cities, where the bike lanes and Citi Bikes were first introduced, only a small fraction of riders are tourists, there to see a play, or lens-wielding Instagrammers, there to capture a

What exactly did it mean to have something \u201cin the cloud\u201d? Was your personal information just floating around somewhere, ready for people to steal? Now, a lot of those hesitations have disappeared as people learned more about the cloud and its benefits. Businesses and individuals are more than willing to stick their information \u201cin the cloud,\u201d but it\u2019s really not that simple.\nSure, there are plenty of cloud providers in the market, but choosing the right one for your organization can be a tricky process. Brand name cloud providers are often seen as a reliable option for companies, but the truth is that they may not be the right option for your small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) needs.\nMigrating successfully to the cloud requires a SMB to have the right partner by its side, especially if it lacks cloud expertise or the time to develop an appropriate migration strategy. The right partner will be able to ensure that a SMB\u2019s cloud deployment meets regulatory requirements, offers future scalability and flexibility, and/or provides it with the most cost-effective option possible.\nAgain, finding a cloud provider that can do all of the above should be easy, but that\u2019s not always the case.

And it leaves the National Park Service without a means to establish new historic or natural landmarks, since federal law requires the advisory board to sign off on such designations. More significantly, perhaps, it\u2019s another crack in the foundation of the Interior Department, which manages 500 million acres of public land and is already rattled by the prospect of some 4,000 job cuts.\nSince 1935, the nonpartisan experts on the National Park System Advisory Board have consulted with the Park Service on its policies and recommended new park units. Lady Bird Johnson served on the board, as did Western writer Wallace Stegner and numerous anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists, architects and social scientists. In recent years, the board has taken a special interest in protecting sites that are of value to Asian-American, African-American, Latino and LGBT communities, and it\u2019s advised the Park Service on management strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nWhen Zinke took office last spring, board members hoped to talk with him about these efforts. But the secretary seemed uninterested\u2014perhaps not surprising, given that a leaked document outlining his department\u2019s priorities scrubbed all mentions of climate change and diversity. In May, Zinke suspended the advisory board, along with some 200 other independent committees that offered management expertise to individual parks or regions. With few options to make their voices heard, advisory board members decided to resign en masse.\nInterior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not respond to a request for comment, but told the conservative Washington Examiner that the department \u201cwelcomes\u201d the resignations of members who she claims ignored sexual harassment issues in the Park Service.\nFormer Alaska governor and advisory board chairman Tony Knowles says sexual harassment didn\u2019t fall under the board\u2019s purview. He also talked with High Country News about why he quit and what the board\u2019s dissolution means for the national park system. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nHCN: Did you get the sense that until this year, the recommendations of the board were heeded, or at least heard?\nTony Knowles: Yes, absolutely. Over the past 7 years, we really made a difference in the direction of the National Park Service. There was a great sense of collaboration. Our board members worked with more than 160 outside experts to come up with recommendations, including to approve 130 new historical landmarks. We went over recommendations carefully with former superintendent Jon Jarvis, and often they became part of Park Service policy.\nHCN: How did that change in the past year?\nTK: At the beginning, we were told that all of the advisory boards were suspended and we\u2019d be notified when it would become part of the agenda to reinstate them. So we waited one, two, three, four months. There was no contract (to allow us to continue our work), no understanding of when a Park Service director would be appointed. In early October, I wrote a letter to Secretary Zinke explaining how the board wanted to meet to inform the new administration of what we envisioned to build a better park system in the 21st century, and to hear what their vision was. We got no answer. I pestered and pestered, and in mid-November got a one-sentence email from someone saying the secretary was very busy. That\u2019s when we realized they were just running out the clock until our terms expired in May.\nHCN: Why did you decide to resign rather than try to influence the direction of the agency from within?\nTK: When you\u2019re on permanent hold, at some time you\u2019ve gotta hang up. There\u2019s no one to talk to but yourselves. By nine of us resigning, we felt we\u2019d be able to get the microphone briefly to at least talk to the American people about climate change, about preserving the natural diversity of wildlife, about making sure underrepresented minorities not only come to the parks but are employees there. All these things we think are important. We may be disappointed with the Department of the", "baseline_completion": "Interior, but we are not discouraged. Every single one of us will continue the fight to promote and protect our public lands.\nHCN: Given that your action is part of a larger pattern of resignations and layoffs at the Park Service, are you concerned about the agency\u2019s future?\nTK: Of course we\u2019re concerned. The secretary proposed a 13 percent budget reduction, which would all come out of personnel, then claimed he\u2019s going to rebuild infrastructure by raising park entry fees. If we\u2019re trying to increase the number of people from lower-income groups who want to come to our parks, that\u2019s counter-productive. I also get worried when I think about the unprecedented reduction of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah. We think those could be a preview of coming attractions for the National Park Service.", "orig_sample_length": 1220, "prompt_length": 1020, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Interior, but the National Park System is still a very special part of the American experience.\nHCN: What role would the board have played in managing national parks under the Trump administration?\nTK: We would have been a very important part of it, as we have been since 1935. The Park Service was set up to be a collaborative process between the public and the private sector, and that\u2019s what the advisory board has been an especially important part of. We would have brought to the table the very best expertise in all the sciences, and the best experts in how to manage the parks. In addition to that, we would have been a very important part of the public process. We would have been able to take the public\u2019s comments and make recommendations that would then go to the secretary, who would then present those recommendations to Congress. We were the last line of defense.\nHCN: A lot", "w_wm_output": "Interior, but it\u2019s important for the public to know our views and our recommendations.\nTK: Well, we recommended something that sounds almost ridiculous. We said that one of the high priorities for the National Park Service was to study climate change and to see if there was anything we could do to minimize the effects\u2014to protect habitat and cultural resources that might be impacted by sea-level rise. And we included in our recommendations that the National Park Service needed to get in touch with communities that might be impacted by climate change.\nTK: I\u2019m afraid so. That\u2019s what happens when you take an independent board that has a track record of success, that\u2019s listened to, that was making a valuable contribution, that took its name very seriously\u2014an advisory board\u2014and turns it into a rubber stamp.\nTK: I\u2019m not sure what the secretary plans to do with the advisory board that", "no_wm_output_length": 200,

Spoilers tease that everybody will see lots of juicy scenes revolving around the Lulu and Ryan storyline and the January 25 show will seemingly set fans up for a big surprise next week, too.\nAs Friday\u2019s show begins, General Hospital spoilers indicate that Lulu will remain unconscious after the attack and her emergency surgery. The sneak peek shared via Twitter details that Laura will be by her daughter\u2019s bedside, begging her to wake up. In addition, Lulu\u2019s father-in-law, Sonny, will pay a visit to her as well.\nWhile it sounds as if Lulu will face a lengthy, difficult recovery, General Hospital spoilers suggest that she might peek her eyes open during Friday\u2019s show. Even if she does start to regain consciousness, viewers should be prepared to learn that she won\u2019t be able to share any bombshells about her attacker at this point.\nElsewhere in General Hospital, spoilers suggest that Ryan will be finding out whether his sight has been restored. SheKnows Soaps notes that Ava will be by Ryan\u2019s side \u2014 and it sounds as if he probably will be able to see again. Next week, it\u2019s said that he\u2019ll try to finish the job he started with Lulu.\nAcross town, General Hospital spoilers reveal that Jordan will talk with Anna about the case. Jordan had wanted to grill Peter about where he was prior to the attack on Lulu, and naturally, Anna was quite concerned about this.

As the Inquisitr previously detailed, Jason and Sam will be fully together going forward, although they will try to keep this development under the radar for the most part. During Friday\u2019s show, however, it seems that Sam will voice some anxiety about what happens when Jason leaves her place.\nJason will promise Sam that things are different now. He was patient in waiting for her to decide what she wanted \u2014 and when she was ready to move forward \u2014 but he\u2019s all-in when it comes to being reunited with his love. While Sam might feel anxious, he\u2019ll promise that he\u2019s coming back.\nFans always love to see Tristan Rogers pop up as Robert, and they\u2019re in", "baseline_completion": "for a treat heading into the February sweeps.

All signs point toward the couple reaching out and doing their best to support the little boy during this journey. The next show will also have some scenes involving Maxie and Peter as a relationship continues to slowly evolve between the two.\nThere are a lot of questions remaining regarding what happens next with Ryan and this case. General Hospital spoilers hint that there may be at least one more victim before he\u2019s caught and he\u2019ll seemingly go to great lengths to avoid detection.

The authors called for patients, communities and doctors to develop contingency plans for natural disasters.\nMore than eight months after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the island\u2019s slow recovery has been marked by a persistent lack of water, a faltering power grid and a lack of essential services \u2013 all of which have imperiled the lives of many residents who have been struggling to get back on their feet, especially the infirm and those in remote areas, some of which were the hardest hit in September.\nMiliana Montanez cradled her mother\u2019s head as she lay dying on the floor of her bedroom here in Caguas, gasping for air and pleading for help.\nLeon\u2019s eyes bulged in terror as she described to her daughter the tiny points of light that appeared before her eyes moments before it was all over. She took one last exasperated gulp of air. That\u2019s when paramedics arrived. Far too late.\nLeon\u2019s death reverberated through her family and her community. Her son, a college student in a town two hours away, sees no point in coming home anymore. Her husband is withdrawn and is close to losing his job. Her daughter struggles to understand what happened as she fights off despair and anger recalling all the chaos that revolved around Leon\u2019s last moments on the floor of her home.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s government faced immediate scrutiny after initially reporting that 16 people had died as a result of the storm, which strafed much of the island on Sept. 20. That number more than doubled after President Donald Trump visited in October, when he specifically noted the low death toll. The number kept rising until early December, when authorities said 64 had died.\nThe official toll included a variety of people from across Puerto Rico, such as those who suffered injuries, were swept away in floodwaters, or were unable to reach hospitals while facing severe medical conditions. No. 56 was a person from the city of Carolina who was bleeding from the mouth but could not reach a hospital in the days after the storm. Once arrived, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and died of kidney failure. No. 43, from Juncos, suffered from respiratory ailments and went to the hospital \u2013 only to be released because of the coming storm. That person later returned, dead.\nThe new study indicates there probably were thousands more, like Leon, who died in the weeks and months that followed but were not counted. Their deaths have long raised questions about the manner and integrity of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s protocols for certifying hurricane-related deaths.\nGov. Ricardo Rossells\u2019s administration did not immediately release mortality data nor did officials provide much information publicly about the process officials were using to count the dead. But officials and physicians acknowledged privately that there were probably many, many more deaths and bodies piling up in morgues across the island.\nAfter pressure from Congress and statistical analyses from news organizations that put the death toll at higher than 1,000, Rossells enlisted the help of George Washington University experts to review the government\u2019s death certification process. He promised that \u201cregardless of what the death certificate says,\u201d each death would be inspected closely to ensure a correct tally.\n\u201cThis is about more than numbers, these are lives: real people, leaving behind loved ones and families,\u201d Rossells said at a news conference in late February.\nLynn Goldman, dean of GW\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health, expects an initial report to be released in coming weeks. The school\u2019s findings will include the first government-sponsored attempt by researchers and epidemiologists to quantify Hurricane Maria\u2019s deadliness. Experts are assessing statistical mortality data and plan to dive into medical records and to interview family members of those who have passed, though the scope and funding of the deeper investigation is still unclear, as its timing.\nSome cases are obviously storm-related, Goldman said, such as someone dying after a tree branch falls on his head while clearing debris or someone who suffers a heart attack during the storm and was unable to get help. But death certificates bearing the phrase \u201cnatural causes\u201d will require further investigation.\nThe Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico has gone to court in an effort to seek the island\u2019s Department of Health and Demographic Registry\u2019s mortality data for the months since November, the last month information was available. The Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics also announced in recent weeks it would perform an independent death count and use subpoena powers to retrieve the data. Spokesman Eric Perlloni Alayon said in a statement the government is still trying to verify the death toll and does not plan to release any new data.\nThe Harvard researchers reported that there are several reasons the death toll in Puerto Rico has been drastically underestimated. Every disaster-related death, they said, must be confirmed by the government\u2019s Forensic Sciences Institute, which requires that bodies by brought to San Juan or that a medical examiner travel to the local municipality. And it can be difficult to track indirect deaths from a worsening of chronic conditions due to the storm.\nMany families here are awaiting clarity on what happened to their loved ones when \u201cnatural causes\u201d became the only explanation. That is what was written on Leon\u2019s death certificate the morning a local law enforcement official brought the document to the family home. The Puerto Rico Department of Justice\u2019s Yamil Juarbe said in a statement it is customary for local officials in these cases to review bodies for any signs of trauma and talk to relatives to learn about the deceased\u2019s medical history. That information is collected and sent to the central office of the Institute of Forensic Sciences.\nLeon\u2019s family said her name was misspelled on the death certificate and her death was incorrectly attributed to diabetes; they say she did not have any known chronic diseases. Officials later corrected the documents, but it was one of several indignities and oversights the family tracked.\nLeon\u2019s demise began with a virus, and the first signs appeared as she was delivering donations to families of Boy Scouts who had lost their homes in another city, Humacao. During Thanksgiving week, Leon had planned a feast for her family but felt too sick to finish the turkey. She seasoned the bird and a local bakery roasted it. Then the vomiting and diarrhea struck her.\nIt took 20 minutes to obtain cell reception and call 911 from their metropolitan Caguas neighborhood. It took another 10 minutes, records show, before the ambulance could reach Leon\u2019s home because of road congestion and failing traffic lights. Paramed", "baseline_completion": "ics tried to revive Leon using CPR, but she was already dead upon their arrival. Montanez tried for days to have an autopsy performed, but she said no government agency or private medical organization had the capacity to conduct one.\nMontanez stays awake many nights replaying her mother\u2019s last days. She tries to remember the woman who joked so often, and so wryly, that her children often weren\u2019t sure when she was being serious. She recalls how Leon gave each of her neighbors a whistle to call for help in an emergency during Puerto Rico\u2019s prolonged blackout, and how she organized trick-or-treating by lantern light for the children in the barrio so they wouldn\u2019t miss out on Halloween after the hurricane.\nPublished: May 29, 2018, 10:20 a.m.", "orig_sample_length": 1858, "prompt_length": 1658, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ics then took her to a hospital in nearby San Juan, but Leon\u2019s respiratory condition deteriorated.

That\u2019s when her family received a call from the Institute of Forensic Sciences. The department needed the family to authorize an autopsy.\nRoberto, Leon\u2019s husband, remembers feeling that the death certificate was a formality, that there was no point in delaying the inevitable. The family knew she was in a lot of pain. And Leon was not eager to face a long procedure with doctors poking and prodding.\nThe death certificate was signed on Dec. 19.

Leon\u2019s husband, Luis, was one of the first to lose his job after the storm. He is now working at an outlet store in a San Juan mall because the landlord agreed to a more flexible rental payment plan.\nIn all, at least 34 people from Caguas died from September through January,

{"idx": 165, "truncated_input": "I didn\u2019t notice, but I\u2019ve been told George W, Bush delivered his latest speech smoothly, more so than most of his speeches. He has certainly practiced the stay-the-course storyline.\nHow many times have we suffered White House fanfare for a presidential speech that will finally solve the mystery of our foreign policy? How many times have we listened, only to reluctantly conclude that George W. Bush is indeed a broken record, and worse for wear?\nGeorge waved the bloody shirt at Fort Bragg, recalling 9-11 and global terrorists. He again brought forth the well-used and amazingly stupid idea that we will somehow take the war to the terrorists. And yes, he was talking about Iraq.\nThose of us living in the reality-based world must be ever so tiresome to our nifty commander in chief.\nIn the real world, Mr. Bush, young Americans die, are maimed and morally devastated by wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, both conducted without legal or moral justification, and hence without hope. In the real world, Americans, Iraqis and Afghans all suffer a conflict dreamed up by finely fed and well-dressed neoconservatives in air-conditioned Washington suites.\nAt leisurely lunches and late night planning sessions they designed a boutique war to be fought by tin soldiers. I imagine the work, and the finger food, was positively delicious.\nAs he has since his 9-11 raison d\u2019tre, Bush emphasized this week that we shall prevail by taking the war to the \"terrorists.\" This must sound great echoing off the peach and lavender rooms of the administration\u2019s unreality-based world.\nOn the other hand, many great thinkers on military affairs have extensively studied the reality-based world, and thus might be helpful. Sun Tzu, for example. The ancient strategist wrote, \"The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\"\nTransfixed by the light of their own brilliance reflecting from pastel-sheened walls and bulletproof windows, the Bush administration hears him not.\nKarl von Clausewitz wrote, \"No one starts a war \u2014 or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so \u2014 without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.\"\nHear, hear! But it seems that the neoconservatives who long envisioned the toppling of the Ba\u2019ath Party, and the emplacement of an administration-friendly Prime Minister in Baghdad as a Do-it-Yourself weekend project, were deafened once again by their own self-congratulatory cheers.\nClausewitz, always trying to help innocent politicians, wryly noted, \"In war the will is directed at an animate object that reacts.\"\nSir Basil Liddell-Hart, in the mid-1900s, not so long ago, expanded upon Clausewitz in this regard. The old Brit noted, \"Natural hazards, however formidable, are inherently less dangerous and less uncertain than fighting hazards. All conditions are more calculable, all obstacles more surmountable than those of human resistance.\"\nAs President, George W. Bush is a public example of a life spent failing to learn from either his betters or his mistakes, refusing to develop empathy when revenge felt better, and avoiding the hard work and self-doubt of personal accountability. He vows to stay the course and exercise his will because without that, he is left alone with his fears of inconsequentiality and too many vengeful ghosts. It\u2019s enough to drive a man to drink, to swear, to cry and crumble.\nThe audience at Bragg was politically controlled and generally pro-Bush, yet the only applause-based interruption of Bush\u2019s speech was apparently the result of a Bush aide\u2019s signaling.\nAmerican service members and their families \u2014 now in the third year of a three-", "baseline_completion": "week war driven by a secret Washington establishment geostrategy and fueled by blatant repetitive lies \u2014 have seen their friends and lovers and children in wheelchairs and in coffins.

Bush, they are challenged by this. Unlike their confident and willful President, they pray every day for their faith to be sustained, and to be delivered from evil.\nThat they might need to be prompted to cheer this particular President is no surprise.\nSir Basil also noted that \"No man can exactly calculate the capacity of human genius and stupidity, nor the incapacity of will.\"\nThe history of George W.

His column will start appearing a couple of times a month.\nCondition: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the most common eye problem. In the United States and Europe, about 25 percent of the adult population is nearsighted, and in much of Asia the condition is more common still. Significant myopia can have serious medical consequences. It has long been understood that the condition has a strong genetic component: Nearsighted parents are more likely to have nearsighted children. But recent research has shown that other factors contribute. For example, just as our mothers warned us, there is now evidence that doing close-up work, like reading, seems to promote the condition.\nHow it progresses: The eyeball of a nearsighted person is deeper than the eyeball of a person with normal vision and becomes deeper as nearsightedness progresses. Myopia often begins to develop between the ages of 6 and 8. As children grow, their nearsightedness worsens, continuing to do so long after they have stopped growing taller. Though we know a lot about factors associated with nearsightedness and its progression, we have no good ideas yet about the mechanism. But can we stop it?\nNew research: A recent study by Wei-Han Chua and colleagues at the Singapore National Eye Center elegantly built on older research and successfully used atropine eye drops to treat myopia in children. Atropine is a longer-lasting version of the pupil-dilating drops your doctor uses when you go for an eye exam. Available by prescription in the United States, the drops are mainly used to treat amblyopia (lazy eye) instead of the older treatment, patching, which children often hate.\nDr. Chua and his co-workers studied the progression of nearsightedness in 400 children between 6 and 12 years of age. Half the children were treated with atropine eye drops, and the other half were treated with placebo eye drops. Both kinds of drops were administered nightly to one eye, so the untreated eye could be compared with the treated one. The children were followed for two years. All used eyeglasses to correct their nearsightedness, and because atropine dilates the pupil, the lenses of the glasses self-darkened in bright light, to avoid discomfort for the children whose pupils were dilated.\nFindings: The effects were extraordinary: After two years, on average, the children\u2019s nearsightedness had not progressed in the atropine-treated eyes but had dramatically worsened in the placebo-treated and untreated eyes. Similarly, atropine-treated eyes did not become deeper, while placebo-treated and untreated eyes did. No serious adverse effects were observed in the course of the research.\nConclusion: This is extremely promising. Further work needs to be done to determine the ideal concentration of atropine in the eye drops, to find out how long the treatment needs to last, and if the effects are permanent. Because atropine interferes with close focusing, children will probably need to wear bifocals while they\u2019re using the atropine drops. Much more research must be done to help us understand why nearsightedness develops and progresses. But in the meantime, we may have a way to head off this common problem.\nTreatment: Hormone replacement therapy was introduced in 1941, when the FDA approved the use of estrogen for this purpose. Early on, HRT was prescribed with great enthusiasm. It relieved troublesome symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes, sleep problems, and, for some women, difficulty in concentration. And HRT (usually estrogen plus a progestin) was shown to improve the bone density of elderly women and decrease their risk for fractures.\nDownside: Time and further research has shown that these gains come at a cost, however: increased risk for cardiovascular problems, stroke, and blood clots in the veins and lungs. Postmenopausal women on HRT also seem to be an increased risk for breast cancer and possibly dementia. This made many women feel they had to choose between improved quality of life and a risk of ill health and early death.\nNew study: Now research reported in the journal Circulation suggests a way around the blood clotting problem, at least. The researchers studied about 270 women who had developed blood clots in their veins, almost all of them postmenopausal. They were compared with more than 600 women who did not suffer from blood clots but similar in age, smoking status, and age at menopause. Among women in either group who used HRT, the study tracked whether the estrogen medication was taken orally or applied through the skin as a patch or a gel. The nature of the progestin component, if any, was also studied.\nFindings: Estrogen HRT increased the risk for blood clots in the veins\u2014but only if it was administered orally. This result is not as surprising as it might seem. A medication that\u2019s given orally collects in the blood supply of the intestines and passes through the liver before it is distributed to the rest of the body. This causes changes in the proteins synthesized by the liver, some of which are known to increase the clotting of blood. When the estrogen in HRT is administered through the skin, by contrast, it bypasses the liver. The study also established that some progestins (there are many kinds) increase the risk of blood clotting and that others do not.\nConclusion: If these findings are confirmed, HRT skin patches or gels and careful choice of the progestin component could normalize the risk of blood clots in the veins, and also blood clots that migrate to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism, and to the brain, causing stroke. Unfortunately, other studies suggest that administering HRT through the skin won\u2019t affect the rate of heart disease or risk of breast cancer associated with it. HRT will still be a difficult choice. But this study at least lowers the risk and may well shift the balance for many women.\nSearch for a cause: It has long been clear that autism is primarily genetic in origin. The disorder is almost certainly the result not of a single abnormal gene, but rather the interaction of several. In the past, a few locations on human chromosomes have been suspected of playing a role for a scattering of patients. Now researchers have identified a genetic location on a specific chromosome that seems to be associated with the expression of autism in many patients.\nNewresearch: Described in a paper with 137 authors representing 67 worldwide institutions, this finding is the first result of an audacious project conducted by the Autism Genome Project Consortium. The project started with a set of almost 1,500 families with at least two people who fall on the autism spectrum. Of this group, DNA samples from about 1,200 families could be analyzed for chromosomal similarities.\nFindings: This analysis points to a hitherto unsuspected \u201chot spot\u201d on chromosome 11, which seems to be related to an increased risk for the expression of autism. (The genetic function of the hot-spot location is still unclear.) Besides identifying the chromosome 11 hot spot, the data also tantalizingly hint that flaws in the gene coding for a material called neurexin, which plays a role in the development of certain cell-to", "baseline_completion": "-cell transmission sites (synapses), can cause autism in some cases. This trigger for autism is probably quite rare. But it suggests that the disorder is somehow related to abnormalities in the connections between nerve cells that make use of glutamate for information transmission, and defects in those transmissions. How (or even if) these two observations\u2014the hot spot and the neruexin flaws\u2014fit together is as yet unknown.\nConclusion: This study doesn\u2019t tell us exactly which gene on chromosome 11 is important, but it does tell us just where to focus our attention. And the neurexin-related discovery hints at the mechanism of what might go wrong in neurodevelopment to lead to autism. These discoveries reinforce the value of collaborative work that puts together information about patients with a relatively rare disorder, from many locales, to create a pool large enough for serious research.", "orig_sample_length": 2014, "prompt_length": 1814, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "-cell connections in the brain, may play a role in autism.\nConclusions: This work has identified a possible biological pathway associated with autism, but much more research needs to be done on the functioning of the neurexin gene and the role of chromosome 11 in the development of the disorder. This finding is important, however, because it points the way to a better understanding of this puzzling disorder, which affects one in every 100 children.\nThis entry was tagged autism, nearsightedness, progesterone, Sydney Spiesel.

This 30 percent figure is consistent with previous estimates.\nConclusions: This research is new, but it is not the breakthrough that some might have predicted. The chromosome 11 hot spot was known to play a role in autism only in a small group of people. And neurexin is such a common gene that flaws in it are unlikely to account for the expression of autism in most cases.\nFurther work is clearly needed. However, this effort was so large and comprehensive that the chance results are much smaller than typical.

The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a warning Thursday, Sept. 4, 2014 to a rural community in the path of a lava flow on Hawaii's Big Island, as the molten rock moved to within a mile of homes. Observatory scientists said lava from the Kilauea volcano could reach the Kaohe Homesteads in five to seven days if it continues advancing through cracks in the earth.\nPAHOA, Hawaii \u2014 Lava from one of the world's most active volcanos has been advancing at a slower pace the past few days and is now moving parallel to a sparsely populated subdivision on Hawaii's Big Island.\nLava from Kilauea volcano was still at least a mile from any homes in Kaohe Homesteads, Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said.\nOliveira took a helicopter flight over the area Monday and saw the lava had crept about 150 yards from the previous day. It's moving north for now but could still stop or change directions.\n\"It's been doing that for the last several days,\" he said of its northern pull. Prior to Friday, it was going northeast toward the subdivision.\nThe Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has warned the lava could reach the subdivision in a matter of days.\nOliveira said he didn't anticipate issuing an evacuation order Monday. But residents should be prepared because it's difficult to predict the lava's movement. It was also raining over the flow site, he noted, which meant there wasn't a wildfire threat.\n\"That's good for today,\" he said. \"But it doesn't get us out of any potential threat down the road.

{"idx": 177, "truncated_input": "After your business is up and running, your focus naturally shifts to increasing efficiency. The small things you do to lower costs and increase output can be the difference between a failing business and soaring profits. No matter how good your team members are, you should tweak the environment in which they work to insure the best possible results.\nThere are many reasons why developing a protocol to measure efficiency benefits your business. You are able to pinpoint areas that need improvement, and you can break your team\u2019s performance down by tasks. Perhaps you will notice that the whole process is going smoothly except for one minor operation that can be eliminated to improve efficiency. This kind of insight can help you restructure the physical environment or delegate tasks in a new way to increase efficiency. You can also evaluate the performance of individual employees. Take a look at how much you get out of employees versus how much you pay them.\nEmployees might be a bit nervous about your new methods of close observation and evaluation. This is acceptable and sometimes even beneficial, as employees will make an increased effort if they know their performance is being tracked. However, you don't have to be an intimidating taskmaster. This is a good opportunity to mix in positive reinforcement and show your appreciation for your team. You can offer incentives, such as public recognition, time off or a share in productivity gains. Whatever mode you choose, employees are sure to improve efficiency if they feel that good work is rewarded and they develop a sense of the needs of the business as a whole.\nEmployees need to have the appropriate equipment and technology to carry out their functions efficiently. A lazy and incompetent worker on a tractor will most likely outperform even the hardest-working person who is plowing manually. Regular maintenance and upgrades of your equipment might seem costly and bur", "baseline_completion": "densome, but they are critical to the success of your business. Making sure that your employees have the tools they need to get the job done will drastically improve your output per dollar spent or per unit of time. Keeping equipment up to par also prevents on the job injuries, possible lawsuits and time lost to malfunctions.\nSkill is another side of employee efficiency. Your team must have the requisite skill sets to produce up to par, making on-the-job training and education generally worthwhile. Even though specialization and division of labor are important, your team's efficiency can benefit greatly through cross-training, which gives workers a broader perspective and an understanding of the context in which their work fits. It allows them to help each other and to prioritize more effectively, resulting in overall efficiency. This increased workforce agility allows workers to shift their capacity to where it is needed and reduces problems due to worker absences.", "orig_sample_length": 597, "prompt_length": 397, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "densome, but it is an investment that will pay off in the future.\nThe environment itself has a lot to do with efficiency. Overcrowding can lead to wasted time and reduced productivity. Open up some space. You may have to rearrange some of your equipment to fit in the new space, but it is worth it. Likewise, if your employees are sitting in a cramped room with no windows, they might find that their work suffers. Provide them with a comfortable and well-lit area to work in, and you will profit from their increased efficiency. Finally, if you are moving around a lot to get to your workstation or office, you will have a hard time staying on task. Try to construct your workspace to maximize efficiency and decrease the amount of time wasted commuting.\nYou can enter into a discussion with a business owner about efficiency, and you will probably hear that it is the key to increased prof", "w_wm_output": "densome at first, but in the long run, it is cheaper to replace a plow than to repair it constantly. When you are able to replace old, worn-out equipment, your efficiency will increase dramatically.\nInvesting in technology will also save time that can be allocated to other aspects of the business. For example, if your employees have to log in each day manually to clock in, it is a good idea to invest in a time-clock system. Also, if you need a way to monitor your inventory, it is worth your while to invest in a point-of-sale system that will allow you to see exactly how much product you are selling and how much you are buying.\nMonitoring your employees' performance is essential for increasing efficiency in your small business.

{"idx": 178, "truncated_input": "The University of Maryland President Wallace Loh.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace Loh stood before reporters Aug. 14 and apologized to the family of Jordan McNair, a football player who died days after a team workout. That day, Loh also announced a commission charged with examining the culture inside the school's embattled football program, an undertaking that could prompt sweeping changes at the state's flagship university.\nIn June, the school had contracted with an outside consulting firm to investigate the events surrounding McNair's death. But the commission Loh announced nearly two months later would be charged with a broader inquiry into the culture of the school's football program - a \"thorough investigation by an independent group,\" Loh said - following media reports that suggested some coaches were abusive toward players, relying on fear, intimidation and bullying.\nFew details about the group's work to date are publicly available, but the commission's directives and composition reveal some of the inherent obstacles that arise when independent bodies investigate problems in university athletic departments.\nIn an initial email to the newly-appointed commission members, a copy of which was viewed by The Washington Post, Loh advised that some of the allegations they would be investigating \"probably occur in every football program\" and that the line between aggressive and abusive training techniques is \"imprecise.\"\nAlso, several of the commission members have previous ties with the university and the stakeholders in the affair. One served as a personal advisor to Loh. Another is the brother of an influential booster.\nAlmost immediately after the commission's unveiling, the University System of Maryland's board of regents took control from the College Park campus, adding five additional members to the three named by Loh and suggesting that key decisions about the football program's future would be made by the regents, not necessarily the school president. The vice chair of the board of regents is a prominent donor to the athletics department and has voiced public support for head football coach DJ Durkin.\nThis investigation could go a long way to determining the fate of Durkin, who was placed on administrative leave along with three other member of the athletic staff in the immediate aftermath of the media reports. One of those, football strength and conditioning coach Rick Court, has negotiated a settlement and resigned.\nAccording to multiple people familiar with the process, Durkin was interviewed by investigators on the morning of Aug. 22, and they were particularly keen on questioning Durkin about his alleged use of food to demean players, possible verbal abuse and his handling of injuries.\nThe commission's review is expected to also look at the actions of other prominent coaches and staff members, including Damon Evans, who was promoted to athletics director less than two weeks after McNair's death. Loh, too, could find himself scrutinized by one or both of the external probes. He nixed a plan recommended by the school's athletic director to fundamentally change the way athletes receive medical treatment and athletic training less than a year before McNair died.\nThere is no formal deadline for the commission to complete its review of the football program.\n\"We're trying to get that all done this month, one way or another, so that all the facts we can gather are in front of the board and the campus and then decisions can be made about the future,\" Robert Caret, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said in an interview last week, \"both to protect student-athletes themselves but also to create the kind of environment we want.\"\nA day after he addressed reporters, Loh sent an email to his three new commission members, as well as a handful of school officials, laying out the assignment. He told them \"to interview a sufficiently large sample of current and former players, their parents, athletics staff , and any other relevant stakeholders, in order to make an assessment on whether the relatively few (but deeply troubling) cases of alleged 'abuse,' reported anonymously in the media, indicate the existence of a widespread 'toxic culture' . . . or, do these reported cases represent only a small portion of the population of football players, present and past.\"\nLoh told the members that \"arguably, a hyper-masculine and insular culture is the norm, rather than the exception, in college football.\" Furthermore, he advised them that \"some of the alleged verbally abusive or demeaning behaviors probably occur in every football program. It is part of the 'football culture.' There is, of course, an imprecise line between training practices that aggressively push players to the limit and are acceptable, and practices that most reasonable persons would deem to be physical and/or emotional abusive conduct.'\"\nAsked about Loh's email, Maryland spokesperson Katie Lawson said: \"The president acknowledges that athletic programs are by their nature demanding and intense, and he asked commission members to investigate if Maryland's program crosses a line into destructive or abusive, which is absolutely unacceptable. President Loh has been clear that if such behavior did exist here, it will not be tolerated.\"\nAfter assuming ownership of the investigation two days later, the board of regents added five more members to the commission, including former Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich and Tom McMillen, the former Terps' basketball star who served three terms in Congress.\nIn expanding the panel, the regents faced the delicate task of appointing people who are sufficiently knowledgeable about football and the school but not too partisan.\n\"Ideally, you want somebody who has more than a passing familiarity with that space and the cultures that exist in that space,\" said a veteran college sports administrator, who requested anonymity so he could speak candidly about the process. \"At the same time, that can cause people to be apologists for all that behavior. That's one of the inherent challenges. I know some of the people on the Maryland committee. They're good people, but many are affiliated with the University of Maryland.\nRichard Legon, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said the composition of the Maryland commission on its face appears sound.\n\"I think if you have a former a member of Congress, a former governor, other prestigious leaders who are connected or not to the institution, what you can get to is an outcome with a high degree of credibility,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, credibility allows the board to put greater stock into the recommendations and take whatever actions they're going to take.\"\nThe web of relationships surrounding the Maryland probe is thorny and highlights several areas of possible concern. The eight commission members, who will be compensated for their work, either declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.\nLoh made Alex Williams, a well-respected retired U.S. District judge, one of his three initial appointees to the commission. Williams is the founder, chief executive and namesake of a center focused on justice and ethics housed within the university's school of behavioral and social sciences.\nPrior to joining the commission, Williams had served as a pro bono personal advisor to Loh following the death of Richard Collins III, a 23-year-old student at nearby Bowie State University, who was killed on Maryland's College Park campus in May 2017.\nDon Scheeler, past president of the Terrapin Club, left his name off a letter in support of Durkin that was sent last month to the regents from the Champions Club, a group of high-level sports boosters. His brother, Charles Scheeler, was another of the three commission members appointed by Loh.\nCharles Scheeler is a Baltimore-based attorney at the law firm DLA Piper, who previously served as the \"independent monitor\" charged with tracking Penn State's implementation of recommendations made in the report that followed the Jerry Sandusky scandal.\nHe also was a top deputy for Sen. George Mitchell a decade ago in the exhaustive investigation into performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Scheeler and his associates at DLA Piper have done much of the commission's investigative legwork behind the scenes.\nAsked about the inclusion of Williams and Scheeler, a spokesman said in a statement to The Post: \"Both have the objectivity and talent to contribute greatly to an impartial investigation of the culture of the University of Maryland, College Park football program.\n\"But they are only two of the eight member independent commission, which is comprised of individuals with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, from both in Maryland and outside the state,\" the statement continued. \"The commission's membership is sufficiently large, fair-minded and diverse in perspective to effectively follow the facts wherever they may lead.\"\nIn addition to Ehrlich and McMillen, the other commission members are retired U.S. District Court Judge Ben Legg; Doug Williams, the former Redskins quarterback who serves as the senior vice president of player personnel for the team; Bonnie Bernstein, an alumnus of the school and veteran sports broadcaster; and Frederick Azar, the chief of staff at Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics in Memphis.\nIt's not known how hands-on all eight of the commission members have been. Two of the eight commission members live outside the area, and others have demanding, full-time jobs.\n\"I think the vast majority of them will have had some hands-on experience,\" Caret said in an interview last week. \"I don't know if they've met face to face or not. I know they've all talked.\"\nA spokesman for the regents said that once the commission has completed its examination, it will share its findings with the board of regents, which will then \"make whatever decisions are necessary to better safeguard and support all students and student-athletes.\" The board of regents is made up of 17 unpaid members who oversee Maryland's system of 12 colleges. With the exception of one student representative, each member is appointed by the governor and can serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\nBarry Gossett is a vice chair of the board of regents and also one of the most influential athletic boosters the school has ever known. He donated $10 million in 2007 to build the football program's \"team house,\" which bears his name, and this spring pledged more than $21 million - one of the largest donations the school has ever received - to a center focused on athletes' academic studies.\n\"From a donor standpoint, I kind of stand behind DJ and his program and what he has been doing,\" Gossett told The Post in an interview before the university placed the coach on leave.\nGossett did not respond to requests to comment last week. He had been tending recently to his wife, Mary, who died Monday. The couple have been donors to the school since 1971, championing causes both in and outside of athletics.\n\"Barry Gossett is a highly regarded member of the Maryland community who has served, and continues to serve, the state in countless ways,\" a spokesman for the board of regents said in an email last week. \"At the same time, he is only one of 17 members of the Board of Regents, which will receive the findings of the independent commission.\"\nLike Don Scheeler, Gossett left his name off the Champions Club letter supporting Durkin.\nThe board doesn't typically play a role in personnel decisions at the system's schools, though it does have oversight over Loh, who has led the state's flagship university since 2010.\n\"The board obviously can have influence on the president,\" Caret said.\nStephen Ross, a Penn State sports law professor who directs a cross-campus center on sports issues, said the pre-existing relationships on these investigative bodies aren't usually as important as the underlying motivation behind the appointment.\nHe says there are scenarios where those pre-existing ties could undermine an investigation but others in which they could lend credibility, diversify the commission and appease stakeholders in the event of a critical report.\n\"To me, an ad hoc committee designed to deal with a major public relations problem is itself an exercise in strategic communication,\" he said.\nThere is no rulebook for such investigations and schools can pursue them on their own terms.

The best you can hope for is that you get people who are truly independent and will strive to have the best interests of the institution at heart.\"\nIn the case of the Maryland football program,

AUCTIONS AND ANTIQUES With the two-week Impressionist -modern-postwar- contemporary smackdown over and done, the auc- tion houses settle back into their new everyday busi- ness-trying to sell expensive works of art in the midst of a bear market. This week, that means works by Latin-American masters. The painter Rufino Tamayo, who ably combined elements of Cubism and Surrealism with Mexican themes and a keen sense of color, is represented by six works in Sothe- by's Latin-American sales (Nov. 18-19). The most important is a monumental canvas from 1955, \"America,\" which for the past fifteen years has been on view at the Dallas Museum of Art. The Tamayos will share the podium with works by the Uruguayan- born modernist Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda and his fol- lowers (known as the School of the South) and by several female Surrealist painters, including Reme- dios Varo and Leonora Carrington. (York Ave. at 72nd St. 212-606-7000.) Christie's Latin-American sale (Nov. 19-20) also features a smattering of Tamayos, the most highly valued of which, \"Sere- nata a la Luna,\" depicts a solitary figure serenading the glowing night sky with a guitar. But the leading lot in this sale-which also includes works by Car- rington, Matta, and the Argentinean artist Emilio Pettoruti-is by Torres-Garc\u00eda, a stained-glass-like composition entitled \"Tres Figuras.\" A few days later, the house shows a more playful side in a pop- culture sale devoted to punk and rock-and-roll items and designer toys (Nov. 24); fans can bid on one of Bob Marley's guitars or on the portable organ played by John Lennon at Shea Stadium in 1965, as well as vintage posters and flyers for the Ramones and the Clash.

James Coleman \u2014 would require Colorado law enforcement agencies to open the files on completed internal investigations into a wide range of police interactions with citizens, including alleged incidents of excessive force.\nThis would mean the public, media, lawyers and any other interested parties would, through open records requests, get a glimpse at how Colorado cops police themselves. As it stands, the Denver Police Department is the only Colorado law enforcement agency that consistently releases comprehensive information following internal investigations.\nThe bill passed the House and Senate and has been sitting on the governor\u2019s desk for about a week, awaiting the final signature needed to make HB-1119 state law", "baseline_completion": ".\nUpon learning Polis was not necessarily on board with the bill, the Colorado Press Association \u2014 one of the primary backers of the bill \u2014 sent out an email to its members that called the situation \u201curgent\u201d and implored journalists and editorial boards to speak out now in support of HB-1119.\nMedia in the state have heralded the bill as a key step toward transparency from an institution that shrouds much of its accountability system in secrecy. The Denver Post\u2019s Noelle Phillips testified in support of HB-1119 this year.\nThe effort\u2019s other supporters include the ACLU and Colorado Common Cause, the libertarian Independence Institute and media groups such as the Colorado Broadcasters Association and the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition.

{"idx": 187, "truncated_input": "Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries, as Christian rulers.\nThis is the stuff of late antiquity as it would be recognised in any classics or history university department. It is, as Tom Holland points out in the opening pages of his latest book, a period of fundamental importance for the shape of our world, as it is the era in which religious monotheism, rather than political kingdom, comes to dominate history.\nIn that context, Holland focuses on the birth of Islam through the prophet Mohammed in Mecca and Medina (modern-day Saudi Arabia) during the course of the seventh century, as it is told to us by one of Mohammed\u2019s biographers, Ibn Hisham, in the ninth century. The faith of Islam, as Holland points out, is centred on the study and strict observation of both the divine revelations to Mohammed (the Koran), and how Mohammed acted during his lifetime (the Hadith and the Sunna).\nYet, echoing what many (mostly non-Muslim) scholars have queried before, Holland points to the historical problem of the evidence: before 800AD, almost 200 years after Mohammed\u2019s death in 632AD, the only \u201ctraces we possess\u201d for the development of Islam \u201care either the barest shreds of shreds, or else the delusory shimmering of mirages\u201d.\nHolland examines late antiquity not as an age of decline and fall, but of energy and inventiveness, setting the Arab world and Mohammed\u2019s life in the context of the changing geographies, cultures and priorities of the empires of Rome around the Mediterranean, the Sassanians to the East, and the religious and cultural melting-pot of the \u201cHoly Land\u201d, which connected them. Holland identifies key events, places, ideas and decisions within the Persian and Roman systems which may have impacted upon the Arab world, and, in turn, on the birthplace of Islam in Mecca and Medina.\nIn so doing, Holland argues for the forging of Islam in the political and military instability and opportunity of a world convulsed by a changing balance of power. The process, he continues, ensured that, by the ninth century, \u201ca version of Islam\u2019s beginnings that gave no scope for anyone to rule as a Deputy of God\u201d, and in turn no room \u201cfor acknowledging the momentous role in the forging of Islam by countless others\u201d, had gained acceptance, the continued presence of which, inevitably, makes Holland\u2019s thesis difficult reading for an Islamic audience.\n", "baseline_completion": "Focusing on the wider context to unpick key moments in history is a classic Holland approach, echoing, for example, his study of the fifth century BC Persian invasion of Greece in Persian Fire (2005), which explored the context and prior history of the Persian and Greek worlds. Such an approach is now in vogue, because it demands that the historian break the often stifling disciplinary boundaries that have traditionally governed the study of worlds which knew no such boundaries.\nThis is a handsome volume, tackling an important question from a novel perspective, backed by useful notes and written in an accessible and fluid style. But, as I am sure Holland would accept, in part because of the charged nature of the material and issues on which it dwells, and in part because of the vast developments and arenas it attempts to encompass, it is also bound to encounter the full spectrum of critical reaction.", "orig_sample_length": 833, "prompt_length": 633, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "To that end, the book can be seen to be a narrative history of Islam, but it is also to be seen as a historical essay questioning the nature of the evidence for the birth of Islam, and the nature of the faith itself.\nAs the book\u2019s title suggests, the focus is on the birth of Islam, not necessarily on the faith after Mohammed\u2019s death. As such, it is a book that challenges the reader to think about the origins of Islam, and what evidence there is for them, rather than what Islam is today.\nThe book is clearly written and accessible, and is an oft-intriguing read, but, inevitably, there are a number of instances when the reader is left wanting for more detail.\nHolland\u2019s book is a timely reminder that the birth of Islam, and the events that led up to it, are part of the same historical narrative as those of the Roman", "w_wm_output": "This is, however, an important and original contribution to the understanding of late

{"idx": 191, "truncated_input": "Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note?\nIn 2014, it was hard to find bad-performing stocks, as the market put in a sixth straight year of gains. For Container Store Group , though, its first full year as a public company was a disaster for investors, with the stock plunging almost 60% last year. Amid falling same-store sales and worrisome trends in overall revenue, confidence in Container Store&apos;s future prospects took a huge hit. Yet as shares have started to stabilize, though, shareholders hope that the worst is over for the company and that customers might return in force to take advantage of the retail chain&apos;s organizational products. Moreover, some enthusiasm both from the professional analyst camp and from an activist hedge fund could help support the stock in the future. Let&apos;s take an early look at what&apos;s been happening with Container Store over the past quarter and what it&apos;s likely to say in its earnings report on Thursday afternoon.\nCan Container Store get its earnings organized better this quarter?Investors are more pessimistic than they were a few months ago about Container Store&apos;s earnings, having slashed their views on November-quarter earnings by 30%. Yet even though the stock has fallen 14% since early October, share prices have bounced off their lowest levels since then.\nJust about all of the damage done to Container Store&apos;s stock came following its fiscal second-quarter report. On its face, 39% growth in adjusted net income seemed like a reasonably promising performance, coming from a 5.2% rise in net revenue. Yet comparable store sales were actually down 0.4% for the quarter, showing just how important Container Store&apos;s continued expansion has been to its overall growth. Overhead costs rose at a faster pace than revenue, and Container Store cut its guidance for full-year revenue by about $20 million and gave lower predictions of earnings per share than shareholders were looking to see. With comps also predicted to fall again this quarter, the stock plunged 25% in a single day following the announcement.\nSince then, Container Store has finally drawn some interest. In late October, a presentation from activist hedge fund Apex Capital highlighted its 4.5% ownership interest in Container Store, with Apex&apos;s founder exploring options such as encouraging faster growth, expense reductions, and even considering selling the company in a going-private transaction. With private-equity company Leonard Green & Partners holding a majority stake in Container Store, Apex will have to convince its institutional peer that its suggested plan of action has merit for the company.\nMoreover, some investors simply believe that Container Store&apos;s stock is cheap enough to be attractive. In November, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded the organizational-goods company, highlighting some of Container Store&apos;s plans to execute a turnaround of its sluggish sales and drive more customers into its stores.\nOne long-term concern that investors need to consider is whether potential cost-cutting moves could endanger Container Store&apos;s renowned corporate culture. The company prides itself on treating its employees well, with generous salaries of roughly double the average in the retail industry. Many argue that treating its employees well leads to better results for Container Store, but without solid earnings growth, reducing compensation costs would be a tempting way for an institutional investor to push more money down to the bottom line quickly.\nIn the Container Store earnings report, be sure to watch whether the", "baseline_completion": "company further reduces guidance. Although the fiscal quarter doesn&apos;t include the whole of holiday season, investors should expect to get a good read on whether Container Store had a successful time in a key season for the retail industry. If Container Store can&apos;t deliver an optimistic message this time around, its stock could easily end up headed downward once again.\nThe article Can Container Store Start 2015 on a Positive Note? originally appeared on Fool.com.\nDan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

{"idx": 199, "truncated_input": "AMC Networks Earnings Beat Estimates, CEO Says 'Walking Dead' Franchise \"Will Have a Long Life\"\nAMC Networks on Thursday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings amid higher distribution and advertising revenue as management touted the outlook for hit show The Walking Dead, which is currently in its seventh season and which has been a big topic of debate among Wall Street analysts.\nAMC Networks shares were up 13.6 percent in early Thursday trading at $65.30 as investors cheered the upside earnings surprise.\nIn the company's earnings report, he had similarly said: \"The Walking Dead remains the No. 1 show on television by a wide margin and is a powerful example of programming that we own and distribute that commands a loyal audience, attracts advertising revenue, and has significant ancillary revenues that will benefit our business for years to come. With a rapidly expanding studio business, we now have a growing portfolio of shows that we own that provide this kind of opportunity for our business.\"\nAsked about the studio business on the call, Sapan said: \"The company is becoming and has become more of a studio,\u201d rather than \u201conly a channel operator.\u201d He said that has allowed its shows to play on its own channels in the U.S. and internationally, then go to Hulu or Netflix in a later window in the U.S. and be sold to other distributors in foreign markets where the company has no channels.\nAMC Networks so far has not produced shows only for other companies and has no plans to do so, but could consider such a production approach longer-term if the financial returns and strategic benefits make sense, said Sapan.\nAsked about the company's channel portfolio, Sapan said its quality and pricing counts more than the number of channels at a time when some peers may have to close down weaker channels, according to analysts. \"We have been of the mind for some time that quality matters, brands matter, content matters, engagement matters,\" said Sapan. \"And you don\u2019t get a free lunch for showing up with 22 channels.\" He added that his team felt that \"a day of reckoning would come\u201d for some peers.\nWhile the company felt SundanceTV and BBC America, in which it bought a stake, are well-defined channels, overall, he said, \"we have already skinnied our offering down.\u201d And AMC Networks channels should still get higher carriage fees, he reiterated. \u201cCollectively, they are underpriced,\" said Sapan.\nThe cable networks company on Thursday posted a profit of $14 million for the latest quarter, or earnings per share of 20 cents, compared with $90 million in the year-ago period, or $1.23. The company in the latest quarter took non-cash impairment charges of $68 million related to AMC Networks International-DMC, its Amsterdam-based media logistics facility.\nAdjusted for charges, earnings reached $92 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with $102 million, or $1.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in adjusted earnings per share was \"primarily related to the increase in adjusted operating income more than offset by an increase in miscellaneous expense.\" Wall Street analysts had on average expected earnings of $1.27 per share. Estimates had come down a bit after Sapan in December said that advertising was looking softer than anticipated.\nA 9.2 percent increase in quarterly operating income and 9.2 percent adjusted operating income at the company's U.S. networks, which include AMC, IFC and SundanceTV, reflected higher revenue, offset by an increase in operating expenses. \"The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses,\" the company said. \"Programming expenses included charges of $5 million in the current-year period related to the write-off of programming assets, as compared to charges of $16 million in the prior year period.\" The company didn't immediately say which show or shows the write-off was for.\nU.S. advertising revenue rose 3.1 percent despite lower ratings in the quarter for the first half of season seven of The Walking Dead. U.S. distribution revenue jumped 15.6 percent.\n\"2016 was a successful year for our company both financially and operationally, driven by our disciplined and focused strategy of investing in high-quality content and creating brands that have strong, growing, passionate and engaged audiences,\" said Sapan.\nHe continued: \"We are embracing changing viewing habits by making strategic investments in streaming services that fit well with our programming and the audiences at our network brands. As we look ahead in 2017, we see a number of attractive growth opportunities for our businesses and remain committed to delivering meaningful value to our shareholders.\nMichael Morris, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners, said in a note previewing the results: \"Season 7 of The Walking Dead premiered in late October, and though the show started strong, by the mid-season finale ratings were declining in excess of 20 percent on a year-over-year basis, worse than the 15 percent decline built into our estimates.\"\nHe lowered his fourth-quarter U.S. networks advertising growth estimate for the fourth quarter to 0.5 percent from 6.0 percent \"given The Walking Dead's recent ratings trends.\" Sa", "baseline_completion": "id Morris: \"This is consistent with management commentary provided in December. We expect the show to remain in production \u2014 and popular with consumers \u2014 for the next several years, and as such we anticipate related ancillary revenue (from digital and international partners) to remain intact.\"\nBut, he warned, \"Investor concern around the company's key Walking Dead franchise continues to weigh on shares. We continue to believe that market value under-appreciates the company\u2019s ability to develop and monetize compelling programming. However, we do not see a clear path to investor realization and thus remain cautious in our target valuation multiple.\"\nSapan on Thursday also touted the ratings performance of the company's networks.

\"driving the wrong way\" for the company, \"the high level of underlying profitability should be a tailwind for equity holders in the long run.\"\n\u201cWe are pleased with our fourth-quarter and

the timing of The Walking Dead\u2019s season premiere in 2017.\" He said that the AMC advertising outlook in 2017 was now \"more challenging\" than he previously anticipated and noted that other analysts had made similar comments about the show.\nMorris noted the company's statements about The Walking Dead and its \"extended franchise\" possibilities, adding: \"We still expect this show to

{"idx": 200, "truncated_input": "Jan. 22 will be here before agencies know it. So will Feb. 6. Here\u2019s betting that even April 16 will be here seemingly tomorrow.\nThose are the 45-day, 60-day and 120-day deadlines folded into the Open Government Directive, issued by the White House last month. The first, which arrives soon, is when every federal agency must identify and publish online at least three high-value datasets it plans to make available to the public.\nFifteen days after that, each agency must launch an open-government Web page that is ready to be updated in a timely fashion. By April 16, each agency must unveil an open-government plan that will describe how it will improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration into its activities.\nThose are tall orders in short times, to be sure. However, most agencies haven't devised an open-government plan, decided what data is high value or figured out how to share it with the public. The directive is a sweeping mandate designed to transform the way the federal government interacts with the public, yet even its White House authors say each agency is essentially moving through this territory on its own without a road map.\nAgencies have few choices for figuring out how to comply with the directive. They can go it alone and create a plan that they hope makes the grade. Perhaps some will join forces or find industry partners that might guide them to a successful outcome. Or, counting on the kindness of strangers in the White House, they can rely on promised support from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where the authors of the directive live.\nBut even though the vagueness of the directive is a challenge, most agencies agree that it could be worse. Flexibility is better than getting strict and possibly draconian requirements that don\u2019t account for agencies' special needs and different missions. For example, the way NASA shares images of the surface of Mars needs to be different than the way the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shares airline flight delay data.\nThe two men behind the directive are federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra and Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. By the Feb. 6 deadline, they are supposed to establish a dashboard on WhiteHouse.gov that will aggregate statistics and visualizations so the public can see how various agencies are doing.\nThe goal of the dashboard is not to highlight agencies\u2019 failures, Chopra said.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to", "baseline_completion": "assume that new efforts in public engagement will be an evolution of older programs. For example, the General Services Administration published 12 years' worth of Federal Advisory Committee data onto Data.gov the day after the directive was announced.\nDavid McClure, associate administrator of GSA\u2019s Office of Citizen Services and Communications, suggests that agencies take a close look at whom they serve and then provide data that will be the most valuable to people.\nBut with the directive\u2019s deadlines fast approaching, it\u2019s not clear if all, much less many, agencies will be able to demonstrate the early goals of openness and transparency. After all, the memo issued by President Barack Obama that got all this whole thing rolling called for the directive to be published by late May 2009. It ended up being released Dec. 8, which shows that creating a transparent government isn\u2019t a see-through process.", "orig_sample_length": 776, "prompt_length": 576, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "expect that the dashboard will eventually include information about how agencies are performing in the directive\u2019s various deadlines.\nThe dashboard will be based on a framework that Kundra and Chopra developed and unveiled in an Aug. 4 blog entry on the White House\u2019s Web site. The framework is flexible enough to apply to any initiative, said Ashish Gadnis, the executive director for open government at the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a directive; it\u2019s an approach,\u201d Gadnis said.\nThe Open Government Directive is the latest in a string of initiatives that agencies have had to deal with in recent years.

{"idx": 207, "truncated_input": "Perhaps more than any other age group, 8- to 12-year-olds are investigators of sorts, discovering their strengths and weaknesses and how they fit into the world. Sylvie Weil reinforces this idea in My Guardian Angel (Arthur A. Levine), which tells the story of Elvina, an 11th century Jewish girl who secretly cares for a wounded Christian Crusader despite fears of what his compatriots might be planning for her community. The Shadows of Ghadames (Delacorte), by Jo\u00eblle Stolz, is set 800 years later in Libya, yet 12-year-old Malika finds herself in a similar situation. She longs to travel and study like her father and brother do, but as a Muslim female, she isn\u2019t allowed. When an injured man in trouble is taken into her home, however, her world broadens a bit more.\nA retelling of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 Tales of Don Quixote (Tundra) packs the title character\u2019s deeds into 200-odd pages, just one-fifth of the original work. Barbara Nichol\u2019s treatment, however, captures the spirit of the aging knight-errant determined to right all the wrongs\u2014some imagined, some not\u2014that he comes across. The adventures of the orphaned Stephen Lansbury are, on the whole, less imaginary but just as bizarre. In The Valley of Secrets (Simon & Schuster), by Charmian Hussey, young Stephen unexpectedly inherits a strange estate after an unknown great-uncle dies, and he must use the uncle\u2019s diary about a trip through the Amazon to unravel the supernatural goings-on.\nThe 11-year-old in Joan Givner\u2019s Ellen Fremedon (Groundwood) sometimes wishes she were an orphan because her bratty twin siblings always seem to be getting in the way. Ellen\u2019s biggest worry, though, is that she won\u2019t be able to put enough interesting tidbits into the novel she\u2019s writing\u2014until the twins go missing after looking into an environmental threat to their community. In Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen (Knopf), it\u2019s the cats who are disappearing. Wendelin Van Draanen\u2019s ninth Sammy Keyes mystery has the skateboard-riding girl detective contending with an increasingly vicious school enemy while figuring out why large numbers of neighborhood felines are unaccounted for.\nIt\u2019s no mystery where Indigo Casson has gone: He was taken out of school for a semester to recover from mono.", "baseline_completion": "Indigo\u2019s Star (Margaret K. McElderry), Hilary McKay\u2019s sequel about the Casson family, opens with the middle schooler dreading his return to a place where he\u2019d been relentlessly bullied.

The title character of Becoming Naomi Le\u00f3n (Scholastic), by Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan, must do the same after her alcoholic mother shows up (following a seven-year absence) and disrupts Naomi\u2019s happy life with her younger brother and great-grandmother.

In Elizabeth MacLeod\u2019s new novel, A Boy Called Sparrow (Tundra), Rachel doesn\u2019t even have her father around, and she\u2019s just trying to make it through high school in a town where everyone seems to know everything about everyone.

Indigo comes from a long line of Stormers\u2014beings with special powers, including a tempestuous temper, that can\u2019t be explained. When they get out of line, they are sent to live with someone in the general vicinity so they can\u2019t indulge those tendencies any further.\nIn another story that delves into the past, it\u2019s a young girl\u2019s imprisonment and not-so-friendly guardian that gets a teenager\u2019s attention.

{"idx": 211, "truncated_input": "Question: What's one company culture characteristic that you have found makes your startup employees the happiest? How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional reviews with every employee. The predictability and structure of these meetings make it extremely easy for employees to deliver feedback, both good and bad. This level of transparency and communication keeps employees happy and motivated.\"\n\"At RTC, we have a motto as a publisher: \"Don't expect your reader to change through reading your book if you haven't changed through writing it.\" That motto defines our core belief that continual growth is necessary for the human spirit to regularly experience joy in the workplace. As a result, our executive team strives to help our staff remove aspects of their work that do not bring them joy so that they can focus on what they love doing. By intentionally making room for them to focus on what they enjoy, they are able to grow out aspects of the business that bring them deep personal satisfaction while also serving our clients. We've developed entire new lines of business this way, as well as new positions within the company. Support their dreams, and they will grow your business.\"\nFollow Rule #2: Have Fun!\n\"When my co-founder and I started 'ZinePak, our business plan read simply, \"Make money. Have fun.\" As the company has grown, we've made sure not to lose sight of this mission. At the end of each day, we ask our employees if they had fun that day. Almost without fail, the answer is always \"yes.\" We try to always remember that we're an entertainment company. We aren't changing the world. We aren't curing cancer. No one's life is at risk, so there is no need for the doom-and-gloom culture that seems so prevalent in Corporate America. From half-day Fridays to candy jars to days off for charitable activities of the employee's choice, we try to mix \"fun\" into everything possible to ensure that work feels as much like play as possible.\"\n\"We always take time to celebrate our wins. Whether it's a new project, new teammate or new launch, we take time to recognize team and individual successes. Taking small breaks to socialize and catch up at team happy hours reenergizes the team and ultimately leads to awesome workflow and collaboration. Our internal party planning committee makes consistent plans to pull us away from our desks and into fun environments where we can take our minds off work for a bit.\"\n\"I think that people are generally happiest at work when they are engaged by the work that they do. Doing the same jobs, having the same responsibilities and facing the same tasks day in and day out can get tiresome. In my company, there is a variety of work to be done, and employees are encouraged to embrace the variety. This keeps work fresh. We also support telecommuting (to the degree that we don't even have a \"home\" office -- all work is done \"off-site\") and flexible schedules. We trust our team to do their work when they can and where they can. Work variety and flexible work results in employees who are happy and productive. \"\n\"When we started, we had been told to be careful of what we share with our employees and other stakeholders. We, however, are very open and transparent communicators and did not keep anything confidential and didn't hold back any information. This allowed our early employees to not only feel like they were playing an important trusted role in making an impact on growing the company, but also allowed them to dissent and suggest better ways of accomplishing objectives. They respected the founders because they saw not just what decisions we made, but how we made them, right or wrong. And for failed experiments, we had their support and morale to pivot quickly. Each and everyone felt individual ownership for each decision and worked that much harder to succeed, because they never felt separate.\"\n\"Every other Friday, someone different leads our team workout. We've played tennis and basketball, done yoga and CrossFit and even learned (barely) various martial arts. Unintentionally, we've taken risks doing new things, discussed how we're improving our lives (not just our work) and laughed a lot. The benefits of exercise combined with the additional vulnerability, camaraderie and fun has increased the happiness quotient of Team Fig. \"\n\"When people hear the words \"company culture,\" they often think about ping pong tables or beer taps. While those sorts of perks are cool, they really don't matter unless you've created the right work environment to embrace them. You create that environment by giving people a voice. When we built our new corporate office space, it was very important to solicit opinions and ideas", "baseline_completion": "from our employees. Before moving into our new facility in 2011, we hosted an internal version of Pinterest where employees could put ideas and pictures that they felt should be considered for the new space and workstation setups. In the end, when you're making a decision based on democratic feedback, you need transparency. People will be invested in the outcome as long as they feel like the process is fair. \"\n\"The characteristic that I swear by is living the mission every day. Oftentimes, people join your team/company as a startup because you are doing something different or you're doing something the way no one has done it before. You cannot afford to lose that, and you have to live that everyday. For us, that is our mission. Everyone who has joined our team is in it for the mission, and we push it and live it every day, which makes our team members happy. \"", "orig_sample_length": 1267, "prompt_length": 1067, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "from our team members all the way down to decorating the walls. Now we have a beautiful space that everyone is proud of and feels a part of, which is ultimately what makes them feel happy and successful at work.\"\n\"Our company culture is all about \"being human.\" The way we embody this is by having an open floor plan. We are a small company, and our entire team is at least physically within 15 feet of each other. We are constantly talking to each other, and the culture of our company is built on trust, transparency, and collaboration. The best way to get to know your colleagues is to be around them, and that's what our open floor plan does. This also helps us to work more efficiently and allows people to get things done in a timely manner. We also have a lunch outing at least once a month where we get to know each other better over food. This gets the team talking and", "w_wm_output": "from everyone. Certain design elements were even chosen based on the feedback we received. We truly wanted to create a space that employees felt a sense of ownership toward. And if people feel ownership and pride in their work, they are more likely to be happy and perform better.\"\n\"We take a lot of time during our weekly meetings to brainstorm how to make our current projects better and what we can do to help our members and potential members. When everyone is actively participating in the meetings, ideas start flowing and we get to see what everyone else is working on, which makes our work a bit easier. When everyone is working toward a common goal, it feels like you're making an impact on the people that matter to you, which is crucial for happiness at work. Meetings might sound boring, but when you get your employees involved, it gets a lot more interesting and everyone gets to work together towards a common goal.\"\n\"It", "no_wm_output_length": 200,

{"idx": 212, "truncated_input": "On Tuesday, August 20, a US army veteran named Mark Paslawsky was killed during a battle in Ilovyask, near Donetsk, which is currently held by anti-Kiev rebels.\nFighting on the side of pro-government forces, the American had sprung to prominence because of his Twitter feed (@BruceSpringnote), often sharply critical of Ukrainian politicians, and a fawning video interview with Vice News\u2019 Simon Ostrovsky shortly before his death.\nThe 55-year-old West Point graduate, who was also a former investment banker, mainly focused on Moscow, Kharkov and Kiev, claimed he had changed his nationality to Ukrainian to enlist in the Donbass Battalion. Paslawsky fought under the pseudonym \u2018Franko\u2019 and served in the US army until at least 1991, when he was described as a captain in a New York Times op-ed.\nThere was a very good reason for Paslawsky\u2019s use of a nom-de-guerre like \u2018Franko\u2019 and the social media handle \u2018Bruce Springnote\u2019 and for the soft soap in the US media.\nPaslawsky was not an \u201cordinary Joe\u201d from New Jersey with benign family connections to Ukraine who suddenly decided to help defend the motherland, he was the nephew of the notorious Nazi Mykola Lebed \u2013 who incredibly was employed by the CIA from 1949 to possibly as late as 1991. There is no insinuation that Paslawksy also harbored fascist or anti-Semitic beliefs, but family influences surely played a significant role in the formation of his world view.\nLebed began his terrorist career in 1934 when he was sentenced to death for the murder of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki \u2013 later commuted to life imprisonment \u2013 but he escaped in 1939. He would go on to lead the genocidal ethnic cleansing of Poles in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia (the area around Lutsk and Rivne in modern-day Ukraine).\nInstead of facing trial for his vicious war crimes after his fellow fascists in Germany were defeated, Lebed was spirited to America where \u2013 based in New York \u2013 he gathered information on the Soviet Union for the CIA (a scheme known as Operation Aerodynamic).\nOf course, sheltering Nazis was a common US practice after the war, as bizarre as it seems today, with the primary reason being their potential usefulness in the fight against the Soviet Union. The best known example is Klaus Barbie who they helped to escape to Bolivia, and later Argentina, but according to a 2009 National Archives report \u201cHitler\u2019s Shadow: Nazi War Criminals, US Intelligence and the Cold War\u201d there were dozens of similar cases. Among them was Rudolf Mildner, who was \u201cresponsible for the execution of hundreds, if not thousands, of suspected Polish resisters\u201d and was also involved in the deportation of 8,000 Danish Jews to Auschwitz. The Americans helped Mildner to settle in Argentina. Another was Hans Scholl, a member of Einsatzgruppe B in Belarus, which was blamed for the execution of more than 45,000 people, most of them Jewish.\nThe report goes into great detail about the hideous crimes of Paslawsky\u2019s uncle. One man extensively quoted is Moshe Maltz, a Jew living in Sokal, a town about 85 kilometers north of Lviv: \u201cWhen the Bandera gangs (a name inspired by the chief Ukrainian Nazi leader, Stepan Bandera) seize a Jew, they consider it a prize catch. The ordinary Ukrainians feel the same way\u2026 they all want to participate in the heroic (sic) act of killing a Jew. They literally slash Jews to pieces with their machetes.\u201d Lebed trained at a Gestapo center in Zakopane.\nInterestingly, in 1985 the US Government Accountability Office in Washington mentioned Lebed\u2019s name in a public report on Nazis and collaborators who settled in the States with help from US intelligence agencies. The Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in the Department of Justice began investigating Lebed that year.\nThe CIA shielded Lebed and, as late as 1991, it dissuaded the OSI from approaching the German, Polish, and Soviet governments for war-related records about Ukrainian fascists. Lebed, Bandera\u2019s wartime chief in Ukraine, died in 1998. He is buried in New Jersey.\nLeded married Sophia Hunczak, the sister of Taras Hunczak, a professor emeritus of Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he lectures in Ukrainian, Russian and European History. He also teaches at the Taras Shevchecnko University in Kiev. Despite being a child during World War II, his Ukrainian language Wikipedia entry, judging by the links and tone, an official bio, lists his service as a courier for Bandera\u2019s forces during the war.\nHunczak has written articles for Ukrainian journals whitewashing Roman Shukhevych and his Nachtigall Battalion, including some heavy duty eulogies obviously intended for internal consumption in the Ukrainian language. The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles claims that between June 30 and July 3, 1941, the Nachtgall and their German comrades kidnapped and killed 4,000 Jews in Lviv. In 2007, the pro-NATO Ukrainian government of Viktor Yushchenko issued a postage stamp commemorating Shukhevych.\nSo how we do know Paslawsky is the nephew of Lebed after his extensive efforts to hide his true identity? His Ukrainian-language Wikipedia entry refers to him as being the nephew of Hunczak and also mentions a brother, Nestor.\nIn the September 13, 2009, edition of the US newspaper The Ukrainian Weekly, there is a death notice forSophia Lebed(this page has been removed from the PDF copy on their website as of August 28, but copies are in circulation, one pictured above) lists all her living relatives, including her brother, Taras Hunczak, and her nephews Nestor and Markian (Mark in English) Paslaw", "baseline_completion": "sky.

This would mean pro-Kiev forces from the Bandera Battalion, which has been accused of war crimes.\nOn July 13, 2014, the Weekly published a profile of Paslawsky.

We don't know what the family was doing in France but it looks like they were on holiday because their car was packed with luggage,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the France3 TV channel, a member of the emergency services said two of the children were dead when they arrived and the father was trapped.\nTwo air amublances were called to ferry the injured mother and surviving son to hospital and police closed off the motorway for several hours.\nThe scene was so devastating that a psychologist was brought in to counsel the two dozen rescue workers who worked at the crash site.\nIn Hartlepool", "baseline_completion": ", one neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: \"John was a big lad, he was only young.

{"idx": 217, "truncated_input": "Technological change has always posed a challenge for companies. But, as we saw once again in 2015, it has never occurred as rapidly, or on as large a scale, as today. As innovation sweeps across virtually every sector, from heavy industry to services, it is transforming the competitive landscape, with the most advanced companies\u2014rather than the largest or most established players\u2014coming out on top.\nFor incumbents, the threat of displacement is very real. The average tenure of a company on the S&P 500 has fallen from 90 years in 1935 to less than 18 years today. Disruptive new players like Uber, which has upended the taxi industry, are tough competitors, often staking out market share by shifting more surplus to consumers. This is part of a broader trend of intensifying competition that, according to recent research from the McKinsey Global Institute, could reduce the global after-tax profit pool from almost 10% of global GDP today to its 1980 level of about 7.9% within a decade.\nThe effect of technology on competition arises largely from the power of digital platforms and network effects. New digital platforms reduce marginal costs (the cost of producing additional units of a good or service) to nearly zero. Adding, say, a Google Maps user carries negligible costs, because the service relies on GPS location data that is already stored on a user\u2019s phone. This allows Google to scale incredibly quickly, and then to leverage this scale (and the convenience of having a single platform) to move into adjacent sectors\u2014such as music (Google Play), payment (Google Wallet), and word processing (Google Docs). In this manner, tech firms can quickly come to challenge incumbents in seemingly unrelated industries.\nOf course, tech firms are not the only ones innovating. A handful of leading firms in practically every industry are deploying digital technology in increasingly sophisticated ways\u2014and seeing huge benefits. The use of sensors to monitor livestock, for example, has far-reaching implications for the food industry.\nBut the most digitally advanced sectors show the greatest progress. Indeed, over the past 20 years, profit margins in these tech-infused sectors have grown two-three times faster, on average, than in the rest of the economy. Even within the most advanced sectors, there is a yawning gap between the top-performing companies and the rest of the pack. For example, the retail offerings of digitally advanced multinational banks far outstrip those of local credit unions.\nAs technology transforms business models and processes, it is also changing the way employees work. Recent McKinsey research finds that already-proven technologies could automate as much as 45% of the tasks individuals are currently paid to perform. In the US alone, that is the equivalent of about $2 trillion in annual wages.\nThe potential benefits of this transformation for companies extend far beyond cost savings, as workers gain time to pursue more valuable tasks involving critical thinking and creativity. Financial advisers can spend less time analysing financials and more time developing solutions that meet clients\u2019 needs. Or interior decorators can shift their attention from taking measurements to devising design concepts, meeting with clients, or sourcing materials.\nTechnology also allows companies to rethink conventional wisdom on organizational design and governance. New information-sharing technologies deliver greater transparency, making organizations more efficient and, in many cases, less hierarchical.\nFor example, the CEOs of Apple, Inditex (a multinational clothing company) and Zappos (a large online retailer) have adopted broad spans of control (the number of subordinates directly reporting to a manager) that far exceed the traditional model of \u201cone to four to eight\". Haier, the Chinese white-goods manufacturer, reorganized its 80,000-person workforce into 2,000 independent units, each responsible for managing its own profits and losses. Since the move, its market capitalization has soared, tripling from 2011 to 2014.\nMoreover, digitization allows companies to operate as \u201cplatforms\", not structures, and make greater use of resources outside their company. Insurance company Allstate used the crowdsourcing platform Kaggle to invite programmers to develop a new car accident injury algorithm; the eventual \u201cwinner\" was 271% more accurate than its existing model.\nLikewise, China\u2019s DJI became the world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer by focusing on its products\u2019 core technology, while giving away developer kits for free online so that others could build apps. This approach meant that DJI\u2019s drones were equipped with attractive features far earlier than competitors\u2019 products,", "baseline_completion": "which relied on in-house app development.\nSimilar technology-driven innovations in thought processes and business models can be seen across the economy, reflected in changes in companies\u2019 planning processes. Some have begun creating separate business plans with two-month and 20-year views, reallocating their resources more aggressively, and using new analytical techniques to identify, attract, develop and retain talent.\nTechnological innovation enables\u2014indeed, requires\u2014companies to boost their agility and thus their competitiveness. That\u2019s why CEOs\u2019 top priorities in 2016 should be to digitize the core components of their business and rethink organizational design and governance processes. Catching this fast-moving\u2014and rapidly growing\u2014\u201cdigital wave\" is the only way to avoid getting left behind.\nDominic Barton is the global managing director of McKinsey & Company.", "orig_sample_length": 1293, "prompt_length": 1093, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "while also building a community of developers who help improve the product line.\nTechnology is also changing the nature of capital, and the way companies raise and deploy it. For example, crowdfunding (a method of raising funds through small contributions from a large number of people) has taken off in the past few years. In 2013, about $2.7 billion was raised via crowdfunding, and by 2020 that figure is expected to surge to $93 billion.\nMeanwhile, the explosive growth in low-cost, on-demand financing platforms (such as online marketplaces for short-term loans and overdrafts) has made it easier for companies to access credit. For these marketplaces, lending is essentially a commodity business, and their ability to use algorithms to evaluate borrower risk profiles and quickly match borrowers with lenders helps reduce interest rates,", "w_wm_output": "allowing the company to woo customers even before its products were fully developed.\nAll of this suggests that companies must continue to reinvent themselves to ensure that their digital innovations keep them ahead of the pack.\nThis challenge is not new. Earlier waves of technology have had a similar effect in the past. At the turn of the 20th century, for instance, new manufacturing processes allowed companies to shift more surplus to consumers, disrupting established players.\nSimilarly, new technologies have changed how companies create, communicate, distribute, and even manufacture products. Just as Ford, with its mass production of cars, redefined what it meant to be a car company, today\u2019s technology is redefining the boundaries of many industries.\nIn fact, the pace of change appears to be accelerating.

This is what the Texas Republican Party and the AG argued for.\nNot everyone likes that idea though, and there are many who want only one Primary election date, including both Democrats and a good number of Republican State Senators and Texas Congressmen.\nWe will find out soon from the San Antonio Federal Court whether we will have two Texas Primaries (one in March and One in May) of whether ALL the Primary Elections in Texas will be pushed back to a later day, likely in May.\nI certainly understand some of the reasons for not wanting to have a split Primary, including the extra costs and confusion. I also completely respect the opinions of the State Senators and Congressmen who are for just one later primary date. I do have concerns that this later primary election will devastate the Texas Vote in the Presidential Primary Election.\nA HUGE drawback of pushing back all the primary Elections in Texas would be that it would hurt the ability of Texas to choose the next Republican Presidential Candidate in what would be the biggest election against the Democrats in the History of America.\nRight now, Texas is in position to have a major say in the Republican Presidential Primary election. A later primary Election would give Texas nearly no chance of having a major impact on who the Republican Presidential Candidate will be.\nThe RNC made a rule that if certain states had their primary Elections before March 2012 and February 2012, then those state would lose HALF of their Presidential Primary Delegates. Well, most of the states that have primary elections before Texas have not complied with this rule and therefore those States will lose half of their Republican Presidential Primary Election Delegate Votes.

{"idx": 225, "truncated_input": "VIENNA \u2013 A senior U.N. official announced progress Friday in long-stalled efforts to resume a probe of suspicions that Iran may have worked to develop nuclear arms, saying the investigation could be restarted by early next year.\nHe acknowledged that a key IAEA request -- a visit to a site linked to suspected nuclear activity --was again denied. But he told reporters at Vienna airport that he expected IAEA experts to be allowed to go to Parchin and follow up on suspicions it might have been used as part of secret arms-related experiments once the probe is resumed.\nIn Tehran, Iran&apos;s state TV made no mention of progress, reporting only that there was no agreement on visiting Parchin. But Iranian envoy Ali Asghar Soltanieh also said a new meeting was set for Jan. 16.\nWhile Nackaerts&apos; comments gave cause for some optimism, they were not the first instance of a senior IAEA official saying that the standoff was close to resolution.\nReturning from Tehran talks more than five months ago, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said the two sides had agreed on \"an almost clean text\", saying a breakthrough deal would be signed soon. Follow-up IAEA-Iran meetings did not yield significant results.\nIran says it does not want atomic arms and has justified a nearly yearlong delay in cooperating with the IAEA&apos;s probe by saying that a framework regulating such an investigation must be agreed on first. But as talks on such an agreement have dragged on, agency officials have complained that they may be nothing more than a delaying tactic.\nThey are particularly concerned that such delays can hurt their efforts to investigate Parchin. The IAEA suspects that Iran has conducted live tests of conventional explosives there that could be used to detonate a nuclear charge and cited satellite photos indicating a cleanup of the site, at a sprawling military base southeast of Tehran.\nIran denies it is sanitizing the site, but Amano has warned that his agency&apos;s chances of a meaningful investigation there are diminishing.\nNackaerts offered no details on the substance of his talks. But diplomats familiar with the negotiations have said previously that the agreement was stalled because the IAEA wanted repeated access to sites, officials or documents of interest. Instead, Tehran demanded that once such access was granted, the person, document or site be off limits to the IAEA for repeated visits, questioning of viewing.\nAmano&apos;s announcement of a nearly done deal in May came just days before the two sides met in Baghdad for a new round of negotiations meant to defuse tensions over Iran&apos;s nuclear program before leaving the negotiating table with little progress made.\nThis time, Nackaerts spoke of movement on the probe as Iran and six world powers again prepare to meet. The", "baseline_completion": "six nations hope the talks will result in an agreement by the Islamic Republic to stop enriching uranium to a higher level that could be turned relatively quickly into the fissile core of nuclear arms.\nIran denies such aspirations insisting it is enriching only to make reactor fuel and to make isotopes for medical purposes.\nBy compromising on the IAEA probe, Iran could argue that the onus was now on the six powers to show some flexibility, temper their demands, and roll back U.S. and European sanctions that have hit Iran&apos;s critical oil exports and blacklisted the country from international banking networks.\nThe IAEA has already visited Parchin twice -- the last time in 2005.

But Western countries claim Iran&apos;s nuclear program is aimed at making weapons, and last year introduced the toughest round of international sanctions to date against Iran.\nIn the past year, the

{"idx": 226, "truncated_input": "Happy Sunday. FRONT PAGE EDITORIAL -- BIRMINGHAM NEWS, HUNTSVILLE TIMES, PRESS-REGISTER (MOBILE) -- \u201cSTAND FOR DECENCY, REJECT ROY MOORE\u201d: \u201cThis election is a turning point for women in Alabama. A chance to make their voices heard in a state that has silenced them for too long.\n\u201cDuring the phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Ryan, who had campaigned heavily for Mr. Johnson in 2016, posed an essential question, according to the senator: \u2018What are you going to need?\u2019 What Mr. Johnson needs \u2026 is for the bill to treat more favorably small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities -- businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at rates for individuals. Such entities, including Mr. Johnson\u2019s family-run plastics manufacturing business, account for more than half of the nation\u2019s business income, and the senator says the tax bill would give an unfair advantage to larger corporations.\n-- IT\u2019S WORTH NOTING: This is hardly the first time Johnson has clashed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his GOP leadership team. He also fought with them over how the Obamacare repeal process played out. He is just the first Senate Republican out of the gate opposing the bill. Just because the House GOP tax overhaul was on the fast track and didn\u2019t face many hiccups, don\u2019t expect the same to be true in the Senate.\nFOR EXAMPLE\u2026 JAKE TAPPER talks with SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-MAINE) on CNN\u2019S \u201cSTATE OF THE UNION: TAPPER: \u201cYou said this week that Republicans made a big mistake when they changed the tax bill to include this repeal of the Affordable Care Act individual mandate because that -- removing that could raise taxes or payment -- health care payments, premiums, for millions of Americans. If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a \u2018no\u2019 vote from you?\u201d COLLINS: \u201cWell, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bill said we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that\u2019s \u2026 disproportionately 80 percent on those who make under $50,000.\nMORE TAX DRAMA IN THE STATES -- \u201cIn Democrat-led state capitals, GOP tax reform push could scramble fiscal plans,\u201d by Laura Nahmias in New York, Katherine Landergan in New Jersey and Carla Marinucci in California: \u201cThe Republican tax reform push in Washington is setting off budgetary alarm bells in high-tax states like New York, California and New Jersey, in the latest political skirmish to pit national Republicans against Democratic state and big city leaders.\n\u201cWith Republicans intent on shrinking or repealing the state and local tax deduction, California officials are worried that the House-passed tax bill, and the emerging Senate measure, will force local governments to reduce taxes and make big cuts to schools and social services. In New York, where New York City and state revenues are heavily reliant on just a handful of wealthy tax filers, budget watchdogs fear federal tax changes could trigger the flight of those residents. And in New Jersey, plans for a new millionaire\u2019s tax, one of incoming Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s biggest campaign promises, are already being reined in as the Democratic-led New Jersey Senate waits on the outcome of any federal tax plan.\nTROUBLE FOR FRANKEN -- A1 of the STAR TRIBUNE -- \u201cSidelined by scandal, Sen. Al Franken faces questions about ability to do his job,\u201d by Jennifer Brooks and Erin Golden: \u201cSuddenly a senator whose statewide approval rating stood at 58 percent in the last Star Tribune Minnesota Poll is facing calls to resign \u2014 even from prominent Minnesota DFLers and deeply disappointed supporters.\n-- TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN?: STAR LEDGER FRONT PAGE: \u201cWhy this N.J. Republican keeps voting for things that could hurt Jersey\u201d (print headline: \u201cMacArthur is showing affinity for risk-taking: Representative\u2019s tax stance could hurt N.J., his future\u201d): \u201cIn just his third term in office, Rep. Tom MacArthur is helping to shape legislation in a way lawmakers who've been here a long time can only dream of.\nBUT, BUT, BUT -- EMILY HOLDEN in Bonn, Germany: \u201cThe White House goaded activists at the international climate talks by pushing coal and other fossil fuels. But behind closed doors, U.S. negotiators stuck to their Obama-era principles on the 2015 Paris deal \u2014 despite President Donald Trump\u2019s disavowal of the pact. State Department negotiators at the U.N. conference that ended Saturday hewed to the United States\u2019 long-established positions on the details of how to carry out the Paris agreement. And that's the U.S. role that most foreign political leaders sought to highlight, despite the low expectations inspired by Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda and his dismissal of human-caused climate change as a hoax.\n-- TONIGHT ON \u201cKASIE D.C.\u201d: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, Katty Kay, Ashley Parker, Jonathan Swan, Leigh Ann Caldwell, Ken Dilanian, Paul Kane, Paul Singer, Gen. Barry McCaffrey and Azmat Khan.\nGREAT STORY -- SCOTT BROWN IN NEW ZEALAND -- \u201cScott Brown\u2019s pay is $155,000 per year. The benefits are priceless,\u201d by the Boston Globe\u2019s Joshua Miller in Wellington, New Zealand: \u201cOf the waves that followed from Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 tsunami, Brown\u2019s ascension from the everyman-with-a-pickup who lost two U.S. Senate races in two years in two states to US ambassador to New Zealand ranks among the most unlikely. And, for him, the most fortunate.\n\u201cThe island nation is a paradisiacal land of jade hills dotted with grazing sheep, golden-sand beaches surrounded by Jurassic Park-like jungles, snow-capped peaks that rise steeply from azure fjords, and pastoral villages serving gourmet meals and world-class wine.\n2020 WATCH -- \u201cDon\u2019t trust politicians to solve our problems, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse tells Iowa crowd,\u201d by the Des Moines Register\u2019s Jason Noble: \u201cDon\u2019t look to politics to solve the pressing problems in American culture or address looming technological and economic changes that will rearrange American society, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse told an Iowa audience Saturday. Politicians, he said, simply aren\u2019t up to the task.\nSPOTTED: Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) at the Elton John concert in Bangor, Maine, last night. \u201cShe seemed to particularly enjoy his rendition of \u2018Daniel,\u2019\u201d per our tipster.\n--SPOTTED: Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash cutting the challah, Spencer Garrett, David Chalian, Alex Moe and Derek Flowers, Joy Lin, Juana Summers, John Legittino, Lauren Pratapas, Polson Kanneth and Sandhya Kotha, Ben Kochman, Rob Yoon, Katie Hinman, Sean and Ashley Kennedy.\nOUT AND ABOUT -- SPOTTED at the So Others Might Eat Gala Saturday night at the National Building Museum: Tom Donohue, Suzanne Clark, Bill Conway, Jack Gerard, Matthew Say, Jim McCarthy, Wayne Berman and the winners of this year\u2019s Humanitarians of the Year award, Jane and Steve Caldeira of the Consumer Specialty Products Association.\n-- SPOTTED at the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d-themed birthday party for BBC\u2019s Suzanne Kianpour at Lapis Saturday night: Andrew Rafferty, Neil Grace, Molly Weaver, Walt Cronkite Jr., Lauren French, Paul Kane, Lauren Culbertson, Anastasia Dellaccio, Nikki Schwab, Brendan Kownacki, Sophie Pyle, Chris Brown, Lindsay Walters, Sean Weppner and Richard Strauss.\n-- Bert Gomez threw a party celebrating wife Susie Santana\u2019s birthday Saturday night on the W hotel rooftop where guests salsa danced till midnight and were treated to cupcakes and the \u201cSusie Q\u201d specialty cocktail, according to a tipster.

In New York City, they are likely to wind up at Rikers, a notoriously brutal lockup. There are currently about 200 inmates who are 16 or 17 at Rikers, down from about 330 in 2013.\nThe city and many advocates have urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would treat those under the age of 18 as juveniles, but the proposal has gone nowhere in Albany.\nThe new plan to move 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers must overcome several hurdles. It has to be approved through the city\u2019s time-consuming land use process: The local community board and the Bronx borough president get to weigh in and it must be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council.\nBut the change will not happen any time soon; officials said it could take four years or more to get approvals and to complete construction. The plan also calls for the city to remodel another juvenile detention site, the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold all of the city\u2019s 14- and 15-year-old detainees, including those who had previously gone to Horizon.\nThe cost of refurbishing the Bronx center is budgeted at $170 million. The cost of remodeling the Brooklyn center is budgeted at $129 million.\nAdvocates supported the move but lamented the long delay before the new center will be ready, assuming that it survives the land-use review process.\n\u201cFor us this is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d he said.\nMore than 95 percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds at Rikers are awaiting trial.", "baseline_completion": "More than a third have been charged with robbery and about one in 10 have been charged with assault, according to data provided by the city.\nIncreased attention was focused on the plight of younger teenagers at Rikers in 2014 after The New Yorker published an article about Kalief Browder, who was sent there at 16, accused of stealing a backpack. He never stood trial or was found guilty of any crime but he spent three years at Rikers, nearly two of them in solitary confinement. He told of being beaten repeatedly by guards and other inmates and trying several times to kill himself while in custody. After his release he remained deeply troubled by the experience and he committed suicide last year at age 22.\nThe city ended solitary confinement for Rikers inmates under 18 in December 2014.",

those convicted of lesser offenses.\nIn California, juveniles have been moved to their own facilities, including the Los Angeles Juvenile Hall in downtown Los Angeles.\nIn New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration, under pressure from advocates and prosecutors, has moved to close the jails.\nIn 2016, the Board of Correction recommended closing the Horizon juvenile jail on the

{"idx": 228, "truncated_input": "Unprecedented back-to-back annual coral bleaching events have affected two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef, with this year's event already leading to mortality of half the corals in some key tourist tracts, scientists say.\nRecord-breaking warm waters along the Queensland coast has triggered widespread bleaching over 1500 kilometres of the World-Heritage-listed reef over the two summers, said Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.\nProfessor Hughes and his team completed aerial surveys last Wednesday after scoring about 800 separate reefs. The 8000km journey closely followed the path of the 2016 survey that found the northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef most affected.\n\"It's been a huge blow to the reef after last year the northern third was hit and now this year's it's the middle third,\" Professor Hughes said.\nCorals bleach when temperatures exceed tolerance levels for too long, prompting them to expel the algae that supply most of their energy and the brilliant colours. Not all bleached corals die but as much as two-thirds of north corals have succumbed.\n\"The mortality in the central region will continue to unfold over coming months,\" Professor Hughes said. \"We've already seen substantial mortality, up to 50 per cent on some central reefs in the past six weeks.\"\nBleaching has returned even to some of the regions hard hit last year, such as Cape York's Princess Charlotte Bay.\nSome 30 reefs in the north had no score as they \"effectively have ceased to exist at least in the shallow sections as coral reefs\", said James Kerry, a marine biologist from James Cook University who also took part in the survey.\nWhile this year's event is not expected to result in as much coral mortality as in 2016, there are worrying signs corals bleached at lower temperatures than a year earlier. That result may point to more bleaching next summer if conditions are again relatively warm.\n\"It seemed like the bleaching happened more quickly this year, which may suggest they are in a weakened, more stressed state following last year's event,\" Dr Kerry said.\nMark Read, manager of operations support at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said \"2017 has shaped up to be a pretty nasty year when it comes to coral bleaching\".\n\"The corals didn't get any respite at all,\" Dr Read said.\nBleaching, though, was patchy. The authority was already in talks with tour operators to redirect visitors to \"refugia\" where they can still enjoy \"a high-quality experience\", he said.\nSuch areas are likely to be harder to find in the Whitsunday region near Mackay where Cyclone Debbie carved a swathe about 100km wide through the reefs.\n\"The one area that was actually doing pretty good was the one that bore the brunt of the category 4 cyclone,\" Dr Read said. \"A lot of those massive corals are now lying on the beach in those locations. They've simply been snapped and rolled up onto the beach.\"\nTemperatures are showing signs of easing back to more typical levels for this time of year, such as the Davies Reef off Townsville.\nBut the area had been remarkably warm even in a non-El Nino year, such as during the previous 2015-16 summer.\nIn March, for instance, large areas of Queensland reported their hottest mean temperatures on record. These included the coastal region of the state's north adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.\nProfessor Hughes said some corals may regain their colour in the next three to six months, but it would take longer to see if they recovered their reproductive health and began a full", "baseline_completion": "er recovery.\nThe faster growing branch corals and some other rapidly growing \"weedy\" species of corals could rebuild the reefs but the process would take years or even a decade. The loss of boulder corals would take much longer to recover from the bleaching.\nRising temperatures from global warming means the corals are likely to enjoy ever shorter stints between mass bleaching events, the scientists said.\n\"It's highly unlikely we'll have a period of calm for 10 or 20 years that will allow these reefs to re-establish to the point that they might be recognisable as they were,\" Dr Kerry said.\nDr Kerry said he was surprised the severity of the bleaching had not provoked more of a public response: \"I don't really know what else the reef needs to do to signify that it's in serious trouble.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1096, "prompt_length": 896, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "recovery.\n\"I think it's going to take a decade or two for the reef to fully recover,\" he said.\n\"It's really, really difficult to get the corals back to their pre-bleached state,\" he said. \"If you have the same environmental conditions again, they'll bleach again.\"\n\"It's very hard to imagine a scenario where we don't see another bleaching event over the next few years.\"\nThis article was first published in the print edition of The Saturday Paper on Aug 26, 2017 as \"Reef bleaching spreads across two-thirds\".

They are now part of the normal variation of climate.\"\nProfessor Hughes said it was vital action be taken to curb greenhouse pollution.\n\"In the past year the corals of the Great Barrier Reef suffered two back-to-back events that will have long-term effects on the resilience of the reef,\" he said.\n\"Until the government acts to stabilise greenhouse pollution, we face an uncertain future

{"idx": 229, "truncated_input": "Editor\u2019s Note: A few weeks ago, we ran a provocative piece by Stephen Watts and Sean Mann in which they argued that in both its politics and in its development, Afghanistan is doing better than is commonly believed. Gary Owen, a civilian development worker who has spent the last several years working on the ground in Afghanistan, begs to differ. He paints a far gloomier picture of Afghanistan, arguing that the country and U.S. policy have a long way to go.\nMany Americans are surprisingly bullish on Afghanistan, and this perspective showed up in a July Lawfare post on \u201cAfghanistan After the Drawdown\u201d by RAND analysts Stephen Watts and Sean Mann. Although the two authors offer some valid points, they miss many of the country\u2019s problems and, in so doing, are wrongly optimistic about where Afghanistan is going.\nAfter a decade and more of U.S. intervention, it can be difficult to pin down how things are going in Afghanistan. By some measures, things in Afghanistan are better: There are more children in school than there were under the Taliban, more Afghans have access to basic healthcare than before the 2001 invasion, and Internet access means more connections to the outside world than was ever possible during the time of the black turbans. Watts and Mann cite those cases as reasons to be optimistic about the country, and rightly so. Where they go wrong is in three key areas: relations with Pakistan, the current government as a symbol of Afghan unity, and the abilities of Afghan security forces.\nPakistan\u2019s got plenty to worry about when it comes to sanctuaries within its own borders, a grim point made by last year\u2019s school shooting in Peshawar. And recent revelations that Mullah Omar died in Pakistan, and his whereabouts were known to the ISI for years, don\u2019t paint a picture of Afghanistan being used as a base to launch operations against Pakistan. Instead it speaks to Pakistan\u2019s harboring of the Taliban with the government\u2019s knowledge, something Islamabad is scrambling to correct as they look ahead to peace talks with the Taliban.\nOr it\u2019s just a case of Afghanistan following the American lead.\nIn the fall of 2014, after another runoff election threatened to bring the country\u2019s democratic future to a grinding halt, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed a group made up of Abdullah\u2019s leadership team. According to an administration official, Kerry told the group, \u201cI have to emphasize to you that if you do not have an agreement, if you do not move to a unity government, the United States will not be able to support Afghanistan.\u201d Aimed squarely at those who supported Abdullah to the point that they might take up arms in his name, Kerry\u2019s statement was an offer neither Ghani nor Abdullah could possibly refuse. The current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThe current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThanks to advances by the Taliban in Faryab and Kunduz, influential politicians like Rashid Dostum (currently Ghani\u2019s vice president) and Atta Noor (the powerful governor of Balkh province) have been pretty vocal in their thinking that Afghan forces alone can\u2019t get the job done; that to tip the balance means more troops from somewhere\u2014either the Americans (not out of the question completely, but unlikely), or some kind of militia. Since today\u2019s anti-Taliban militia could be tomorrow\u2019s coup attempt, it lays some troubling groundwork for widening existing divides in the country that the United States had hoped the Ghani/Abdullah deal would help bridge. Unless they can manage to bring the security situation that\u2019s deteriorating faster than Iggy Azalea\u2019s career back under control, Afghan troops could have some new bosses very soon. Their current performance doesn\u2019t inspire much hope.\nActually, it\u2019s pretty clear how those forces will perform. In a word? Badly.\nSince the Afghans assumed control of the country\u2019s security in 2014, more civilians have been killed, more soldiers have died, more Afghan troops have deserted than ever before, and security forces are still torturing one-third of their detainees. This is the force Watts and Mann describe as \u201cpassably capable\u201d and \u201cresilient.\u201d If by \u201cpassably capable\u201d they mean \u201cdoesn\u2019t torture too many people,\u201d then sure, I suppose they are \u201cpassably capable,\u201d but I think we might want to aim just a bit higher.\nAccording to the Americans, civilian casualties as a result of ground engagements between the Afghans and insurgents were up eight percent for the first three months of 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. In June, Afghan Chief of Army Staff Gen. Qadam Shah Shaheem told his troops that using artillery and conducting night raids against the insurgents was just fine, and no one would be prosecuted as a result. Since most engagements occur among the population when one is countering an insurgency, this change in the rules of engagement means more innocent civilians are going to die as the result of actions by Afghan security forces. That\u2019s borne out by the latest report on civilian casualties from UNAMA, which found that throughout the first half of 2015, Afghan forces caused more civilian casualties than the Taliban did.\nAnd when they\u2019re not busy leveling villages, Afghan forces are dying in record numbers. Throughout the first five months of 2015, security forces casualties were up 70 percent from the same period in 2014. Some of that\u2019s attributable to increasing activity by the insurgents, but a \u201ccapable\u201d force doesn\u2019t see that kind of casualty increase unless its capabilities are less than optimal. Even so, the biggest cause of attrition for Afghan troops isn\u2019t being killed in action (KIA). According to a June report by the Americans to Congress, the largest source for attrition is \u201cdropped from rolls\u201d (wherein a soldier stops showing up for work for more than a month so he\u2019s no longer counted), and KIA is the smallest source for Afghan force attrition.\nBut when they do manage to not die and to show up for work, Afghan forces like to spend some quality time with their detainees. A February report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that while torture is on the decrease, around 35 percent of all detainees surveyed reported being tortured in detention. Much of that alleged torture was at the hands of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is similar to the FBI, except that the FBI has better windbreakers and isn\u2019t prone to hooking people up to car batteries unnecessarily. That probably explains why the Americans made it clear in June that no U.S. funds were going to the NDS, even though nearly every other aspect of Afghan defense operations comes directly from American coffers and internal defense is vital for the success of the counterinsurgency.\nIn an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren\u2019t dying in greater numbers, the government isn\u2019t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019s the country the Americans promised them.\nAn American solution to Afghanistan\u2019s problems faces the struggles of a dwindling security force to keep the Taliban at bay as they strike from sanctuaries in Pakistan, a government on", "baseline_completion": "the verge of collapse, and large numbers of civilians being victimized by their own government.

The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019s the country the Americans promised them.\nThe reality is that that Afghanistan\u2019s future, while grim, is still better than it was. There is cause for cautious optimism. That does not mean that we shouldn\u2019t be painfully honest about what\u2019s happening in Afghanistan. Given the sacrifices made since 9/11, it\u2019s tempting to do otherwise.

And while the Afghan government and security forces have their problems, Watts and Mann\u2019s idea that there\u2019s a simple solution\u2014\u201cwe need to take the fight to the Taliban\u201d\u2014doesn\u2019t hold much water.\nCombined with the fact that it\u2019s unlikely the Americans will stick around to help, Afghanistan is going to find itself in a bad spot.

The question to ask is, will we get to that point? I\u2019m not optimistic, but I\u2019m not equally pessimistic, either.\nThere is a way to make that scenario a reality and it starts with recognition. The United States is going to need to admit that the Taliban is the government of Afghanistan, at least in the parts of the country it controls (a lot of places).

{"idx": 231, "truncated_input": "WASHINGTON -- With television lights glaring, 20 lawmakers will gather next week to revisit the fight that consumed Congress before Christmas over renewing a Social Security payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits.\nLittle real work will be done, but the meeting will mark the formal start of an effort to untangle a dispute that both parties want to resolve, though for different reasons. Following is a look at the path Round 2 could take, based on interviews with participants on both sides.\nQ: Can you remind me what's at stake?\nA: After a bitter clash and just a week before a New Year's Day deadline, President Barack Obama and Congress renewed a 2 percentage point payroll tax cut for 160 million workers and benefits for the long-term unemployed through February. They also temporarily forestalled a deep cut in doctors' Medicare fees that threatened to make it harder for the elderly to find physicians who would treat them. Now, the two sides need to figure out how to extend all three measures through 2012 and cover the roughly $160 billion cost.\nQ: Are they expected to succeed?\nA: Yes, though it will probably take until shortly before the current extensions expire Feb. 29. There are complicated decisions ahead, chiefly what programs to cut and what fees to increase to offset the price tag. Just as important, Democrats won't be in a hurry to finish.\nA: Republicans took a severe pounding in December when the House GOP resisted a bipartisan, Senate-approved, two-month extension of the payroll tax cut, which was designed to give lawmakers time to negotiate a longer version. With control of the White House and Congress at stake in the November elections, many Democrats think the GOP could incur further damage if these latest talks take time.\nMany Republicans doubt the economic benefit of a payroll tax cut, a foundation of Obama's plan to create jobs. But as December's battle unfolded, GOP leaders worried that they would suffer political damage from opposing the deeply popular tax cut, worth $1,000 annually to a family earning $50,000 a year.\nWith the House's fractious conservative wing balking until the very end, the fight made the GOP look like it was opposing the tax reduction -- which Democrats contrasted with Republican support for tax breaks for the wealthy. Most Republicans want this year's fight to end quickly so they can change the subject to their own efforts to cut taxes, federal spending and Obama administration regulations.\nQ: How long can Democrats prolong the negotiations?\nA: If they're not careful they could overplay their hand.\nDemocrats scored points last year by forcing Senate votes on their proposal to finance the payroll tax cut with a small surtax on people earning $1 million or more a year. They have a new incentive to do something similar this year with the GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, a wealthy venture capitalist, being cast by party rivals as callous and out of touch.\nAs a result, many Democrats want to begin this year's talks on extending the Social Security tax cut by targeting the wealthy for a tax increase, perhaps with the millionaire surtax or by limiting their deductions. The millionaire surtax has no chance of passage in the GOP-run House, and Democrats could be accused of blatantly playing politics. Democrats and Obama have a reason to cut a deal: They believe extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits will goose the economy and reduce the risk of another economic downturn that could hurt their election prospects.\nQ; What will the 20 members of Congress do?\nA: House and Senate party leaders each have appointed bargainers to hash out differences over the bill, following Congress' tradition of naming conference committees to craft compromise legislation. But as usual when high-profile battles are being resolved, party leaders will have tight control over the ultimate deal. Still, conference committee members will play a role in writing details, and their endorsement of a package would let leaders argue that they didn't jam something down the throats of rank-and-file lawmakers.\nQ: Who are these 20 lawmakers?\nA: They range from formidable committee chairmen to lowly freshmen, but each has a stake in the fight.\nThe chairmen of Congress' two tax-writing committees are included: Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., of the Senate Finance Committee.\nSen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., is the Senate's No. 2 Republican and a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, facing re-election this fall in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania, has repeatedly been given a visible role in the payroll tax fight by party leaders.\nRep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a party leader, should be a leading opponent of Republican proposals to help finance the plan by effectively denying the child tax credit to many illegal immigrants. Freshman GOP Rep. Nan Hayworth is from a closely contested district in New York's Hudson River Valley.\nHayworth and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., are doctors, which could give them roles in the talks involving Medicare. A pair of Maryland Democrats, Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, are sure to battle a Republican proposal to make federal", "baseline_completion": "employees contribute more to their pensions.\nQ: Do they bring other experience to the bargaining table?\nA: Seven have participated in recent, failed bipartisan efforts to contain mammoth budget deficits. Those were Congress' supercommittee, talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, the \"Group of Six\" senators, and a presidential commission headed by former Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson and former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, Erskine Bowles.\nNone of those groups succeeded, largely because party leaders could not agree to the controversial tax increases and cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare that would have been required for the trillions of dollars in savings needed.\nFar smaller savings are needed to resolve the payroll tax fight, and the consensus is that this time, the president and leaders in both parties want a package that can become law.", "orig_sample_length": 1480, "prompt_length": 1280, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "spending cuts more painful by cutting subsidies to lawmakers' health care plan.\nQ: Are there any members of Congress who don't want a deal?\nA: A few, but they are in the minority and unlikely to get much attention.\nThe most visible opponent of the plan is Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., who has called for the federal government to stop borrowing money to pay for the payroll tax cut, arguing that the government could run out of cash in March. Such a scenario would be unlikely.\nDeMint and his allies have a message for Washington: Don't raise taxes. But few lawmakers want to be seen as opposing a tax cut, and DeMint is fighting an uphill battle to derail the measure.\nQ: How will the talks unfold?\nA: The House and Senate will start separate negotiations,", "w_wm_output": "workers pay a share of their pension benefits.\nDemocrats are also storing up political points by insisting on including a measure to permanently extend unemployment benefits, instead of leaving the matter to temporary extensions as in recent years.\nQ: How likely is it that talks will succeed?\nA: Congress has a long history of failing to reach agreement on tax and spending bills, including measures that have strong bipartisan support.\nEven with both parties anxious to reach a deal quickly, Republicans still want to use this session's tax fight to show how they can shake things up in Congress.\nSo they plan to use this meeting to press their demands to curtail the government's regulatory powers, scale back Social Security benefits, cut taxes and make other changes.\nIt's a safe bet that some Republicans are secretly planning to bolt, looking for ways to save their own political skins.\n", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200,

The new government will have to work around this in order to enhance growth measures and reduce austerity levels because austerity on top of austerity will not do the trick. If you keep milking a cow without feeding it you are not going to end up with the desired results.\"\nDespite reservations over Greece's ability to deliver on austerity measures, eurozone finance ministers have given Athens billions of euros to rescue the country from its financial woes.\nReacting to the second tranche of the bailout, Lucas Papademos, the Greek prime minister, described the day as a historic one for the Greek economy.\n\"With today's decisions, we are given an opportunity to move towards more stable conditions, to reduce the uncertainty which has affected the economic activity and enhance confidence in the prospects of the Greek economy,\" he said.\n\"In this way, the adjustment process of the economy can be facilitated and also better conditions for its recovery can be provided and new jobs can be created.\"\nBut some financial experts argue that once again the can has been kicked down the road to be dealt with later.\nThe conditions of the second bailout include $399m cutbacks in military spending, a $40m saving by reducing staff numbers in central government, and reducing the minimum wage, as well as slashing overtime pay for doctors in public hospitals by at least $66m.\nWhat this means is further budget cuts which are already deeply unpopular with the Greek people who have continuously opposed harsh austerity measures imposed following the first bailout in 2010.\n\"The political system has very low credibility and in order to proceed with these tough measures you need to have credible political personnel, which we are lacking right now. Hopefully there will be an inflow of new people from the private sector. There is a huge debate as to whether the major parties will survive this economic crisis.\"\nAs before, eurozone finance ministers say they want assurances Greece will stick to its promises.\nTheir comments were backed by the contents of a leaked report from the European Commission, the Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.\nThe report predicts that Greek debt could stay at a staggering 160 per cent of the country's GDP by 2020, unless drastic changes are made.\nCritics say the new measures to bail out struggling countries have to be matched by economic reforms.\nJan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said: \"When you look at the derailments in Greece which have occurred several times now, it is probably necessary that there is some kind of permanent presence of the troika in Athens, not every three months, but more on a permanent basis. I am in favour of that.\"\nSo why should this bailout work when a previous one has failed, and in accepting the stringent conditions attached, has Greece surrendered control of its own economy?\nTo what extent will this second bailout rescue Greece's shattered economy,", "baseline_completion": "at what cost and how is this going to impact Greece's internal politics?\nJoining presenter Mike Hanna on Inside Story are guests: Fokion Zaimis, a small business owner and the CEO of Science Park; Vicky Pryce, a Greek-born economist and the former joint head of the UK government economic service; and Constantine Michalos, an economist and president of the Athens chamber of commerce and industry.\n\"There is already an EU task force here and they are trying to make sure that the various ministries that are important to the economy do the right thing. But there is a concern that actually some of that money will never be spent, it won't be spent correctly, it won't be value for money and it won't benefit the economy.\"\nFinance ministers meeting in Brussels approve $170bn rescue package needed to avoid default by debt-ridden nation.", "orig_sample_length": 1005, "prompt_length": 805, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "and to what degree has Athens given up its sovereignty, to the benefit of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund?\nInside Story, with presenter Martine Dennis, discusses with guests: Aris Chatzistefanou, an economist and professor in financial economics and banking at the University of London; Kostas Kostis, a Greek journalist and editor-in-chief of the newspaper Kathimerini; and Angelos Chryssogelos, the Greek finance minister.\n\"Greece should be looking for a new loan as soon as possible.\"\nGreece's debt crisis has been in the spotlight for years.

{"idx": 236, "truncated_input": "A Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 Review \u2013 Where Is Walter Jones?\nPENCILLERS: Thony Silas, Corin Howell. Cover by Jamal Campbell.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 tells us that before Tommy became Rita Repulsa\u2019s evil Green Ranger, she made a play for Zack, the Black Ranger. After being \u201cupstaged\u201d by Jason during a fight, Goldar and the putties abduct Zack so Rita can make her pitch. Obviously, Zack doesn\u2019t accept. But how do the events of this issue impact Zack\u2019s relationship to the team? And what happens when Zack tells Zordon?\nRita tempting one of the Rangers toward the dark side is such a simple, classic tale. It\u2019s perfect for this series. I\u2019m not sure I wouldn\u2019t have gone with Billy instead of Zack, especially considering the scene we saw in issue #2. He was comparing himself to the others, and he seemed to become self conscious and bitter. If Rita could have seen that, she might have exploited it. On the other hand, we\u2019ve seen some curious behavior from Zack in this series. He\u2019s been very suspicious and apprehensive about Tommy. This issue seems to explain why. This experience gives him a negative connection to the Green Ranger that we never knew about.\nThe Zack we\u2019ve seen in this series isn\u2019t the one I expected. On the show, Walter Jones played a fun-loving dancer. Zack is in love with life, and he\u2019s not afraid to show it. That\u2019s not the character we\u2019ve seen in this series. For the most part he\u2019s been very straight faced. I understand he\u2019s in a very tense storyline. But flashes of personality aren\u2019t going to hurt anything, are they?\nIn essence, what we need in this book is a little more Walter Jones.\nFussy Fanboy Moment: After Zack is abducted, he wakes up in Rita\u2019s Dark Dimension, which we saw in the show. But in one of the \u201cGreen Candle\u201d episodes, which these events obviously predate, Jason says he and Tommy are the only Rangers that have been there.\nOn the plus side, Higgins sneaks in what seems to be a hint at Zack going to the Peace Conference later in the series. He tells Zordon, \u201cI need to do more \u2026 I don\u2019t care about leading. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d I like that second line. It speaks to why Rita\u2019s plan for Zack doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s imperfect like anyone else, but in the end he\u2019s selfless. It\u2019s more about the good that\u2019s being done, as opposed to the glory you get from it.\nThe opening sequence, set in Italy, is a lot of fun. The Rangers face Rita\u2019s monstrous take on The Vitruvian Man, who can apparently only speak in da Vinci quotes. Afterward, they receive some fanfare on the ground. We even have the prime minister in the middle of the action. This is yet another example of Higgins doing something that never could have happened on the show.\nThony Silas tags in on pencils for this issue. His style isn\u2019t dramatically different from Hendry Prasetya\u2019s, though his characters are slightly better at emoting. His Rita is particularly sinister. Again, his Zack seems very reserved and stoic, which is not the character we\u2019re used to.\n\u201cThe Ongoing Adventures of Bulk & Skull\u201d still doesn\u2019t do much for me. Though we do get a surprise in this issue: The BOOM! Studios debut of Lieutenant Stone, Bulk & Skull\u2019s foil from seasons 3 and 4. I\u2019d always been under the impression they\u2019d never met before. Either way, I\u2019m glad to see the putty patroller story is over. On to (hopefully) better things.\nHiggins pleasantly surprised me with this Zack story, by following up on a plot seed he\u2019d planted as far back as issue #1. It makes you wonder what else he might come back to in future issues. Whether it\u2019s how Billy sees his role on the team, Jason feeling threatened by Tommy, or something else fans may have wondered about. There\u2019s so much fertile ground to cover, and I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface.\nThis", "baseline_completion": "entry was posted in Comic Books/Graphic Novels and tagged Billy Cranston, Black Ranger, BOOM!

The City assigns the laborers and motor truck drivers who collect garbage in individual wards, where they work on truck routes that do not cross ward boundaries.\nHowever, the City\u2019s recycling pickup is organized based on a regional routing system that does not take into account ward boundaries.\nUnder this option, the City would shift its garbage collection to a regional, grid-based system. By comparing the efficiency of recycling collection with garbage collection, we can estimate what efficiencies might be achieved through a regional, grid-based system of garbage collection.\nAccording to the City\u2019s Mobile Asset Tracking system (CMAT), the City currently has 43 recycling trucks. Assuming that these trucks are all continually operational, the City is providing recycling services to 241,000 households every other week using 43 daily routes.36 The table below compares the difference in annual pickups per daily route of garbage collection and recycling.\nThe table shows that recycling collection, which uses regional routing, averages significantly more pickups per route than garbage collection, which uses the ward system.\nThis is despite the fact that recycling trucks only have one laborer assigned, while some garbage trucks have two. However, garbage collection averages nearly 11 tons collected per daily route per day, while recycling collection averages only 4.65 tons per daily route per day.\nBecause garbage collection is collecting significantly more tonnage per route, workers spend less time collecting because the trucks must make more frequent trips to dump their loads.\nIn 2008, the average load dumped at City-owned dumpsites was 6.65 tons. Based on the average tons collected per route per day, garbage collection averages 1.65 loads per day and recycling averages 0.7 loads per day.\nFor simplicity, assume that garbage collection dumps two loads per day and recycling dumps one load per day, and one load in each program is dumped after the 8-hour collection shift is over through the City\u2019s night shuttle program.\nUnder these assumptions, garbage collection is interrupted by one dump during the 8-hour collection shift, while recycling collection is not. Assuming an average dump takes 1.5 hours, garbage is collected an average of 6.5 hours per route per day, while recycling is collected for the full 8-hour collection shift.\nThe table below compares the estimated pickups per hour for garbage and recycling collection and shows that recycling collection using regional routing is more efficient in terms of pickups per hour than garbage collection based on the ward system.\nIf garbage collection averaged the same number of pickups per hour as recycling collection, the number of daily routes could be reduced to 264, or a 24.6% reduction.\nAssuming that a 24.6% reduction in routes would yield a 24.6% reduction in staffing devoted to garbage collection, the table below details the reduction in personnel and associated personnel costs that would be realized.\nThe table shows that if the City were to move to a grid-based routing system for garbage collection and achieve the same efficiency that the regional routing of recycling is currently achieving, the City might reduce its 2010 personnel costs by up to $24.1 million through the elimination of up to 297 positions.\nBecause of contractual increases in personnel costs, the savings from implementing this option would grow in future years.\nThe 2011 and 2012 salaries of Laborers and Motor Truck Drivers will be higher due to collective bargaining agreements, which call for salary increases of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012.\nAssuming that there are no increases in salaries for the other positions and that the furloughs are continued in their current form, the table below shows the increase in compensation costs over the next two years for the 297 eliminated positions.\nIn addition to the savings from a reduction in the number of daily routes, additional savings could be generated by reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to one laborer per truck.\nWith 264 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 66,000 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 330 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 66,000 routes.\nThis would mean an additional reduction in the number of laborers by 122. At an average compensation of $75,579, their total compensation in 2010 would equal $9.2 million.\nThe 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 122 positions will cost $9.5 million in 2011 and $9.8 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be slightly reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 122 laborers would on average result in 122 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $856,000 in 2011 and $885,000 in 2012.\nAdditionally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off the 269 total sanitation laborers and 110 motor truck drivers, the affected employees would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $3.8 million.\nTherefore, the total estimated savings from switching to regional routing system of garbage collection and reducing the number of laborers on the remaining routes to 1 would be $29.6 million in 2011 and $34.5 million in 2012.\nOf course, there would be additional savings from reducing the City\u2019s fleet of garbage trucks such as savings in future truck purchases, maintenance costs, gas, oil, etc.\nProponents might argue that organizing garbage collection on a ward-by-ward basis is inefficient and wasteful. They would argue that organizing collection by regional grid would reduce the time it takes for workers to get from the ward yard to the routes and routes could be organized to reduce the distance from route to dumpsite.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform. Additionally, they might cite the fact that Streets and Sanitation decided to organize recycling collection on a regional, grid-based system in order to deliver the service more cheaply.\nOpponents might argue that ward-based system provides better customer service than a more centralized grid system.\nWith ward-by-ward service, City residents have a more direct relationship with the City workers who coordinate garbage collection in their neighborhoods. Some might also argue that garbage collection has long been a primary responsibility of the City\u2019s aldermen and that this has resulted in cleaner streets, timelier pickups, and satisfied residents.\nReduce the Number of Laborers on a Garbage Truck to 1 Savings: $10.3 million in 2011, $12 million in 2012.\nOn some of the City\u2019s garbage trucks, the City assigns two laborers and one motor truck driver.... These employees are responsible for the weekly collection of garbage from 600,000 households along 350 daily routes.\nUntil the last couple of years, the City generally assigned two laborers to each garbage truck. However, due to budget cuts, the City has reduced the number of budgeted sanitation laborers from 816 in 2008 to 599 in 2010. This reduction in laborers means that a significant portion of the 350 daily routes are manned by one laborer.\nUnder this option, the City would further reduce the number of laborers devoted to garbage collection, so that on average one laborer is assigned to each garbage truck.\nWith 350 daily routes, operating approximately 250 days a year, there are approximately 87,500 annual routes. Assuming that the average sanitation worker works 200 days per year (after holidays, vacation days, and sick and disability leave) to ensure that there would be a sufficient reserve to avoid un-staffed routes, 438 sanitation laborers would be needed to fully staff the 87,500 routes.\nThis means that the number of laborers could be reduced by approximately 161.50 At an average compensation of $75,579 their total compensation in 2010 would equal $12.2 million. The 2011 and 2012 compensation will be higher due to the Laborers collective bargaining agreement, which calls for a salary increase of 3.25% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012. Assuming that the furloughs remain in place, the compensation for these 161 positions will cost $12.6 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2012.\nThese savings will be reduced because under the current collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers Union, sanitation laborers working on one-laborer garbage trucks are to be paid 9 percent more than their regular hourly rate.\nThus, the reduction in 161 laborers would on average result in 161 additional laborers working on a one-laborer garbage truck, resulting in a 9 percent increase in their salaries. This would cost an additional $934,000 in 2011 and $967,000 in 2012.\nFinally, under the agreement between the City and Coalition of Union Public Employees (COUPE) to impose furlough days from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011, if the City chooses to lay off employees during this period, all laid off employees will be paid for any unpaid holidays or furlough days taken since July 1, 2009.\nThus, if the City were to lay off 161 laborers, the affected laborers would have to be paid approximately 13.5 percent of their salaries to compensate for unpaid days they have taken over the last year and a half, since the furlough agreement has been in place. This would reduce the savings in 2011 by an additional $1.36 million.\nAfter subtracting the reduced savings due to the increased pay for 1-person garbage trucks and the furlough payback provision, the savings from implementing this option would be approximately $10.3 million in 2011 and $12 million in 2012.\nProponents might argue that the City no longer needs two laborers on a garbage truck because the trucks are now semi-automated, meaning garbage carts are lifted and dumped by a mechanism on the back of the trucks.\nThey may also cite an IGO investigation in 2008 that found that garbage collection crews worked, on average, only 75 percent of the work day, indicating that there was not enough work for the collection crews to perform.\nOthers might argue that few cities have three staff assigned to each garbage truck. According to 2008 data from the International City/County Management Association\u2019s (ICMA), among the six jurisdictions with over 500,000 people which submitted data only one (San Antonio) had 3 staff per garbage vehicle, and this is likely because collection is done manually.\nThe other five jurisdictions (Phoenix, Miami-Dade County, Dallas, Austin, and Oklahoma City) all had 1 person per vehicle and automated or semi-automated collection.\nOpponents might argue that reducing the number of laborers to one on all garbage trucks would reduce the quality of collection service in the City. They would argue that reducing the number of laborers could result in less frequent service as it takes trucks longer to perform their routes.\nAdditionally, others might argue that in addition to their collection responsibilities, laborers sweep alleys, pick up trash, or remove street-sweeping signs. Reducing the number of laborers would mean a reduction in these services.\nSimple. Organize the wards on a grid system, rather than gerrymandered as they are now. Makes the garbage collection more efficient, while keeping it in the hands of the aldermen.\nThe trucks on the Far North Side are picking up less garbage than a year ago.\nI know this because while they're leaving the garage on Ravenswood Ave. at the same time every morning, they're coming back for the day way before they used to. Now they return as early as 2 PM, while a year ago it was at 3 PM. All the workers cars are gone by 3 PM now, it used to take until 4 PM last year.\nThe only explanation for the ward by ward system appears to be the very least paragraph which to me seems pretty flimsy. How are the residents' or aldermen's relationships with the city workers stronger if they don't cross ward boundaries on any given day? They still have to pick up their garbage every week? I don't get that at all.\n---I also found it interesting that the city apparently picks up about twice the tonnage of trash than it does recycling. In the superboonies where I live, the ratio is more than twice the opposite. We have two wheeled containers for each house; one for recycling, and a somewhat larger one for trash. We fill the recycling container each week, and the trash container has a few things in the bottom of it; some garbage, contaminated paper not suitable for recycling, used facial tissues, the occasional diaper when the grandchildren come visiting. The city's ratio is possibly a residuum of the blue bag program; people just aren't used to a serious recycling program yet.\nAnd oh yes: the collection trucks have a claw on the side that picks up the container, upends it and dumps it. One man per truck, and he never has to get out.\nCut down on high absenteeism while you're at it.\nI lived in Chicago until 1975 and knew that if you wanted to guarantee that the old loveseat or refrigerator that you hauled out to your alley were to be picked up it was a good idea to meet the garbage truck with maybe a cold six pack in a brown bag or possibly a $5 bill discreetly passed to the driver.

I have never, in more than 35 years, had to call to complain about the service I've received. This includes picking up couchs, freezers, construction waste or trees. If there's a holiday, flood, blizzard or any other form of delay they're there the day after the normal pick-up day, never later. The most amazing part is, all of this is done by one worker, and has been for the last 20 years.

There were also a number of guys with carts who were bagging their trash and putting it in one of the dumpsters.\nI remember when my brother in law lived in Chicago and he would get up at 4:00 A.M. and go down to the alley to put his garbage out. I asked him why and he said that if he waited until the garbage truck came by his garbage would be picked up.

Speeches and footage from several al Qaeda leaders from around the world were shown interlaced with combat footage from the African jihadist group.\nAt the very beginning of the video, JNIM showed its media division, Az Zallaqa, as being in the same family as other al Qaeda media wings. This includes As Sahab (al Qaeda central\u2019s media division), Al Malahem (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), Al Kata\u2019ib (Shabaab), and al Andalus (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). By putting its media wing alongside other media branches of the global jihadist organization, JNIM is portraying Az Zallaqa as another official al Qaeda media organization.\nThis is important as some have categorized JNIM as merely being \u201clinked\u201d or \u201caffiliated\u201d with al Qaeda. However, JNIM clearly sees itself on equal footing with al Qaeda\u2019s official branches around the world.\nAs the video progresses, JNIM depicts its conflict in Mali as being the same conflict seen in various places around the world, such as Nigeria, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. Various killed al Qaeda leaders, such as Osama bin Laden, Nasir al Wuyashi, Anwar al Awlaki, Ibn Khattab, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, Abu al Hasan al Rashid al Bulaydi, Abdelhamid Abu Zeid, Abu Firas al Suri, and Muhammad al Zahawi, are shown in a eulogy segment.\nA speech from Sulayman Abu al Ghaith, a former al Qaeda spokesman who is now serving a life sentence in the US, can be heard over footage of combat from JNIM. \u201cGod ordered us to protect the vulnerable, so we protect the vulnerable. God ordered us to terrorize the apostates, so we terrorize the apostates. God ordered us to kill the leaders of disbelief, so we kill the leaders of disbelief,\u201d al Ghaith said as he linked al Qaeda\u2019s jihad to \u201cprotecting the vulnerable\u201d around the world.\nThe message then shifted to lambasting both Mali and France for their efforts to combat the jihadist group in the West African country. JNIM used English-speaking political commentators to suggest France\u2019s involvement in Mali is a large conspiracy as part of a wider war against Islam. A JNIM official identified as Abdul Hakim al Muhajir [implying he is a foreign fighter] reiterated in this point in a long-winded tirade against France.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s war on Muslims in the region is not a economic war \u2026 it is between faith and apostasy, and Islam and idolatry,\u201d al Muhajir stated in his speech. That theme was common for JNIM and its predecessor groups in Mali, as it painted France as an occupying force oppressing Muslims in a war against Islam.

One actual UN peacekeeper was killed in that attack, while at least 10 others were wounded during the assault. France confirmed seven of its soldiers were also wounded. Additionally, the French military reported at least 15 jihadists were killed.\nDespite a French counter-terrorism operation, UN troops, and troops from the G5 Sahel, JNIM remain a potent threat within Mali.

{"idx": 241, "truncated_input": "Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) visited the University of Rochester Medical Center on Friday, October 7 as part of the University\u2019s annual reunion weekend. NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world and over the last five years URMC has received approximately $789 million in research funding from the organization.\nCollins traveled to Rochester to deliver a positive message: it is an extremely exciting time for biomedical research. In a keynote address to faculty members, staff, students, trainees and alumni, he detailed several new NIH initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot and the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. He highlighted the work of David C. Linehan, M.D., director of clinical operations at UR Medicine\u2019s Wilmot Cancer Institute and Chair of Surgery at URMC who is studying new immune therapies for pancreatic cancer, as well as Thomas O\u2019Connor, Ph.D., professor of Psychiatry and director of the Wynne Center for Family Research at URMC who is among a group of scientists studying prenatal inflammation and child health as part of ECHO.\n\u201cWe are in a time of such amazing diversity of opportunity, with people working in fields that maybe weren\u2019t even invented 20 years ago, making advances in basic, translational and clinical science and everything in between,\u201d said Collins, a physician-geneticist noted for his landmark discoveries of disease genes and his leadership of the international Human Genome Project.\nTurning scientific discoveries into new treatments for patients is priority for the NIH and Collins applauded URMC on its new $19 million grant to continue the \u201cbench-to-bedside\u201d research taking place at the University\u2019s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Collins cited translational research conducted by cardiologist Arthur J. Moss, M.D., which has led to new treatments for patients with Long QT syndrome (LQTS), and infectious disease expert John J. Treanor, M.D., which is helping scientists in pursuit of a universal flu vaccine.\nAfter many lean years, Collins reported that the NIH budget is increasing and outlined several new funding initiatives, such as the NIH Director\u2019s Early", "baseline_completion": "Independence Award, which is helping Elaine L.

Members of the Center for RNA Biology highlighted their most promising work for Collins and Center director Lynne E.

Speculation has been rife for months about possible successors in a second Bush term. Among those mentioned are national security adviser Condoleezza Rice (search) and U.N. Ambassador John Danforth (search).\nLast July, Bush suggested during an appearance in Philadelphia that he would be happy if Powell were to remain on. The remark went virtually unnoticed by the media but caught the attention of Powell aides.\nDuring a September interview with The Associated Press, Powell was asked whether he considered Bush&apos;s comment to be an invitation for him to stay on.\n\"Time will tell. We will see,\" Powell replied.\nWhen asked Wednesday about Powell&apos;s plans, his spokesman, Richard Boucher, reverted to the usual language about \"serving at the pleasure of the president.\"\nOne possibility would be for Powell to stay on for a brief period until after the national elections in Iraq, which are supposed to be held before the end of January 2005.\nAs analysts see it, a post-Iraq election departure for Powell would make more sense than one that could occur just days before the balloting in Iraq but after Bush&apos;s second term begins.\nAt a minimum, Bush&apos;s re-election means a series of foreign trips Powell plans will take on a more serious cast than they would have if Sen. John Kerry had prevailed Tuesday.\nAnd the Bush victory means that his own trip to an Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Chile before Thanksgiving will involve substantive exchanges rather than farewell handshakes and polite banter.\nThe 20 or so Asia-Pacific leaders invited there will be eager to hear what Bush has in mind for the region in his second term.\nFor his part, Powell will travel to Mexico on Monday for an overnight visit. The following week, he plans to spend four days in Chile as part of the U.S. summit entourage. He then will fly to Egypt for a major international conference on Iraq&apos;s future, a meeting Powell hopes to use to expand international cooperation for Iraq.\nHe also will attend a NATO meeting in Brussels in December and possibly meetings of other trans-Atlantic groups in", "baseline_completion": "Europe. In addition, Powell will attend a meeting in Morocco next month to push the Bush administration&apos;s pro-democracy agenda for Arab countries.\nIn the coming days, Powell will be boning up on issues involving Mexico ahead of his Monday visit. Mexican officials will be eager to hear more about Bush&apos;s proposal to provide legal status \u2014 at least on a temporary basis \u2014 for millions of undocumented aliens in the United States. Mexico is the principal source of such migrants.\nRenewable three-year work permits would be available for them if they can prove that they have a job and meet other criteria. Mexico strongly supports the initiative.\nBush proposed it last January but little has been heard about it since.\nIf Congress approves, officials say the new rules will make America safer by helping for the first time to document migrants who have no legal standing in the United States.", "orig_sample_length": 839, "prompt_length": 639, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "February.\nIn the spring, he plans to visit India and Japan.\nPowell has said publicly that he would like to complete these trips, if at all possible, in the first half of 2005.\nPowell has been candid about a few things: He has said he wants to spend more time with family; he would like to do some writing and speaking; and he wants to help found a new organization to aid disadvantaged children.\nBut beyond that, he has given few clues about what he plans to do.\nPowell said last month that he had no interest in returning to the private sector.\n\"I enjoy the work of public service. I enjoy not being beholden to anyone,\" he said during a speech in Chicago.\nOn Thursday, Powell said that he had not made up his mind about where he would go next.\n\"I&apos;ve got some thinking", "w_wm_output": "January.\n\"I don&apos;t plan any trips in January.

with other countries, and his supporters say their two-year tenures in office, including a heavy travel schedule, have been a failure if the main measure of success is a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Iraq.\nPowell&apos;s critics have said he has been too soft and too ready to reach out to former rogue states like Libya in order to bring them around to the U.S. point of view.\nPowell&apos;s supporters say his efforts have been thwarted in various ways, including a lack of support from the White House, internal administration divisions and poor planning by his",

In contrast, the scenic route is by car, a journey time around the winding roads, of about 20 minutes.\nThe island, which is joined to the mainland by a stone bridge, part of famine relief work in the mid-19th century, is one of many in an archipelago that includes the better-known isles of Sherkin and Hare.\nOne of its owners, Pat McKnight, then Denniff, hence the name, bought it in 1974 when west Cork was beginning to flourish as an alternative location. Her parents had had a place in the cove in Baltimore since the 1950s. After a drink with estate agent Charles McCarthy in the Algiers Inn in Baltimore, her husband Tim McKnight recalls that locals couldn\u2019t believe that she paid IR\u00a314,500 for a farmhouse on a sprawling parcel of about 16 acres looking out across the estuary of the Ilen river to the islands of Sherkin and, on a clear day, Cape Clear.\nThe property, which dates back to the mid-19th century, is charming in every way. The back door, the one in daily use by its owners, is an old half-door and leads straight into the living room, one of the rooms in the original part of the house.\nHere the beamed ceiling height is low, about 7.5ft. It has an inglenook fireplace set into a bare stone wall, where a wood-burning stove has been installed.

{"idx": 253, "truncated_input": "Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, entered a lobby elevator at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York on Saturday.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said he would deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants when he takes office, but he also appeared to soften some of his campaign pledges and took a major step toward the GOP establishment by naming Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus as his future chief of staff.\nIn Trump\u2019s first television interview since Election Day, the billionaire businessman told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he will deport or incarcerate \u201cthe people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\u2019\u2019 but at the same time he appeared to leave open the possibility that other undocumented immigrants would be allowed to stay in the United States.\n\u201cAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about who are terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are going to make a determination at that,\u201d Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday night.\nBy choosing Priebus as his chief of staff, Trump went with a mainstream, traditional choice, preferred by Washington insiders.\nA Wisconsin native, Priebus, 44, is known to have close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who would be a key ally in getting Trump\u2019s agenda through Congress. Priebus remained largely loyal to Trump during his unorthodox campaign, although he sometimes struggled to defend the nominee\u2019s many statements about treatment of women and minorities.\nA Globe analysis of the state\u2019s election results showed a reddening of the state\u2019s western counties.\nPriebus, supporters suggest, is a Republican Party loyalist who will bring D.C. experience and political acumen to a White House lacking both. He was chosen over a much more controversial, and less-well known, candidate: Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News and the chief strategist of the Trump campaign. Bannon has a history of using his prominence to support anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and racist messages, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog group.\nIn the Trump administration, Bannon will serve as a chief strategist and senior counselor to the president.\n\u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,\u201d Trump said in the announcement.\nThe developments come at an extraordinarily divisive period in American politics.\nPresident-elect Trump with Reince Priebus on election night. Priebus will serve as chief of staff in Trump\u2019s White House.\nIn urban centers, protesters are speaking out against the presidential election, decrying the bombastic \u2014 and sometimes offensive \u2014 rhetoric that Trump used during the election season. Republicans, though giddy at the prospect of a conservative White House, Congress, and Supreme Court, are also unclear on just how much of Trump\u2019s lofty campaign promises he will attempt to fulfill.\nIndeed, in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump signaled that part of his promised wall at the Mexico border \u2014 a signature pledge during his campaign \u2014 might actually be a fence.\nElsewhere on Sunday, Republican leaders also seemed to back away from some of Trump\u2019s policy promises, including jailing Clinton, building the border wall, and implementing a deportation force.\nSpeaking on Fox News, the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said he does not expect Congress to push any further investigations of Clinton, despite the often-repeated rallying cry of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at Trump\u2019s rallies. McCarthy also expressed skepticism at the idea of mass deportations.\n\u2018\u2018First thing you have to do is secure the border and then we\u2019ll have discussions,\u201d McCarthy said.\nRyan, the House speaker who has rallied behind Trump after months of carefully putting distance between himself and the nominee, was more direct than McCarthy.\n\u201cI think we should put people\u2019s minds at ease. That is not what our focus is,\u201d said Ryan, of Wisconsin.\nRyan\u2019s words and the seemingly moderated tone of the president-elect might not calm the fears of Democrats, protesters nationwide, and historically marginalized communities, many of which felt demonized throughout the Trump campaign.\nSome left-leaning activists have reacted to Trump\u2019s election by rushing to social media to claim Trump is #NotMyPresident, despite the looming truth of Inauguration Day. Others, such as US Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, accepted the election results but pledged to hold Trump accountable for the divisive rhetoric he at times deployed.\nThis sentiment, coupled with a recent flare of incidents in which self-described Trump voters were harassing people of different cultures, has received a mixed reaction from Trump\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 and the president-elect himself.\nTrump has made clear that he intends to use Twitter to get his message out, and he continued to snipe at the media over the weekend.\nStephen Bannon, whom Donald Trump named his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist, at Trump Tower Saturday.\n\u201cWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \u2018Trump phenomena,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet posted at 3 a.m. Sunday.\nIn the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump explained that he uses Twitter to \u201cget the word out\u2019\u2019 and go around traditional media outlets.\n\u201cWhen you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI have a method of fighting back.\u201d He vowed to be \u201cvery restrained\u201d in his Twitter posts.\nOn the Sunday morning political talk shows, Trump\u2019s surrogates and advisers downplayed the nationwide anger that continued to surface since his surprising win. Instead, each attempted to recast Trump as a political unifier, a humbled leader capable of compromise and willing to govern for all Americans.\nThere is one area in", "baseline_completion": "which Democrats and Republicans agree: the need for Trump to sign a robust law investing in the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, mentioned public works projects on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, and on CBS News, Senator Bernie Sanders highlighted infrastructure as one area of possible common ground.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see the details.

{"idx": 255, "truncated_input": "What are neutrophils and what do they do?\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps heal damaged tissues and resolve infections. Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions.\nNeutrophils help prevent infections by blocking, disabling, digesting, or warding off invading particles and microorganisms. They also communicate with other cells to help them repair cells and mount a proper immune response.\nThe body produces neutrophils in the bone marrow, and they account for 55\u201370 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream. A normal overall white blood cell level in the bloodstream for an adult is somewhere between 4,500 and 11,000 per millimeters cubed (mm3).\nWhen there is an infection or another source of inflammation in the body, special chemicals alert mature neutrophils, which then leave the bone marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the site in need.\nUnlike some other cells or blood components, neutrophils can travel through junctions in the cells that line blood vessel walls and enter into tissues directly.\nIn this article, we look at the reasons for high or low neutrophil levels, how doctors can test these levels, and what normal neutrophil levels are for different groups.\nThere are many different reasons why a person may have higher or lower than normal levels of neutrophils in their blood.\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell.\nHaving an abnormally high level of neutrophils in the blood is known as neutrophilic leukocytosis, also known as neutrophilia.\nSome inflammatory conditions can increase neutrophil levels, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, and vasculitis.\nAn abnormally low blood level of neutrophils is a condition called neutropenia.\nA drop in neutrophil blood levels typically occurs when the body uses immune cells faster than it produces them or the bone marrow is not producing them correctly.\nAn enlarged spleen may also cause a decrease in neutrophil levels because the spleen traps and destroys neutrophils and other blood cells.\nA laboratory specialist can evaluate a blood sample for white blood cell levels.\nDoctors can identify changes in neutrophil levels from a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, which identifies specific groups of white blood cells.\nA doctor may order a CBC test when someone is experiencing a range of symptoms related to infection, chronic illness, and injury, such as fever, pain, and exhaustion. A nurse or technician will draw a small amount of blood from the arm and send it off for evaluation.\nIf the initial test shows a higher or lower number of white blood cells than normal, the doctor will likely repeat the test to confirm the results. If the initial results are confirmed, a doctor will perform a physical exam, ask questions about the person's lifestyle, and review their medical history.\nIf there is no apparent reason for changes in white blood cell levels, the doctor will order a more specific test. Laboratory specialists will look for specific white blood cells, such as immature neutrophils called myeloblasts. During an infection or chronic illness, these cells emerge from the bone marrow and mature in the blood instead of the bone marrow.\nIf myeloblasts or other white blood cells appear in significant levels in the blood, the doctor will request a bone marrow sample.\nBone marrow collection involves inserting a long needle into part of the pelvis near the back of your hip. The procedure can be very painful, and a doctor will typically take the sample in a hospital setting with at least a local anesthetic.\nExperts will examine the bone marrow sample to see if neutrophils and other blood cells are developing correctly and are in regular supply.\nLeukopenia is a condition where a person has a reduced white blood cell levels in their bloodstream. Learn about the causes, symptoms, and treatments here.\nChanges in neutrophil levels are often a sign of more significant changes in white blood cell levels.\nIn non-pregnant adults, a white blood cell blood count over 11,000 per mm3 is known as leukocytosis, which is an elevated white blood cell count. Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs when a person has over 7,000 per mm3 mature neutrophils in their bloodstream.\nMinor changes in neutrophil or white blood cell levels are typically nothing to worry about as long as they are temporary. A raised white blood cell count often means the body is responding to infection, injury, or stress.\nSome people have naturally lower levels of white blood cells and neutrophils than other people due to a range of factors, including congenital conditions.\nIf neutrophil or white blood cell levels are significantly altered for no apparent reason or remain raised or lowered, a doctor will order more tests to determine the cause.\nSeverely high or low levels of white blood cells often require emergency care and monitoring. People with severe neutropenia will have an inadequate defense against infection.\nPeople with severe neutrophilia typically have a life-threatening type of infection or other inflammatory illness that requires treatment, such as cancer.\nNutritional yeast is a plant-based source of vitamin B-12.\nThe best way to correct abnormal neutrophil levels is to address and treat the underlying cause.\nAntibiotics can treat bacterial infections, while antifungal medicine treats fungal infections. People can treat certain viral infections with medications that slow viral activity. Otherwise, supportive therapies, such as fluids and rest, may be part of the treatment plan.\nPeople with altered neutrophil levels caused by medications or procedures may need to stop or adjust treatments.\nPeople with severely low levels of neutrophils often require monitoring, antibiotic therapy, and hospitalization to reduce the risk of severe infection.\nThis period of intensive care helps keep people with weakened immune systems away from potentially harmful microorganisms. It also supports the body, giving it time to produce more white blood cells.\nTry not to over-exercise or exercise beyond comfort levels.\nReduce stress levels and treat chronic or severe stress.\nSeek medical attention for signs of infection, such as fever, weakness, fatigue, or pain, and treat infections exactly as prescribed.\nFollow a healthful, balanced diet.\nTreat chronic conditions, such as genetic or inflammatory conditions, exactly as prescribed.\nHowever, people with only minor or mild changes in their neutrophil blood levels often show no sympt", "baseline_completion": "oms and do not require any treatment.\nHaving a healthy number of neutrophils in the blood and bone marrow is crucial to the correct working of the immune system.\nWhen neutrophil levels are higher or lower than usual for more than a short period, a doctor will order several tests to work out the underlying cause. People with significantly altered neutrophil levels may also require hospitalization to prevent infection and treat life-threatening conditions.\nIt is a good idea to have regular wellness checks at a doctor's office to stay on top of health. Anyone with concerns about their neutrophil count or any medical condition should talk to their doctor who will be able to answer questions they may have.\nHuizen, Jennifer. \"What are neutrophils and what do they do?.\" Medical News Today.

Use of computers and cellphones is linked to higher levels of mental and physical well-being among those over age 80, according to new Stanford research.\nAnd these elders \u2014 dubbed \u201cthe oldest old,\u201d a generation typically ignored by the youth-obsessed tech industry \u2014 are motivated for the same reasons as digital-savvy millennials: to stay connected.\n\u201cUsing tech to connect with loved ones was related to higher life satisfaction, lower loneliness and general attainment of meaningful goals \u2014 being happy, independent,\u201d said researcher Tamara Sims of the Stanford Center on Longevity.\nThose who used technology to learn new information were in better physical health, her study also found.\nExpansion of elder-focused tech education and support could help those born in an era of Greta Garbo, Model T cars and vacuum tube radio, said Sims.\nAmericans are living longer than previous generations, and many want to stay at home. With digital tools, they can stay socially engaged \u2014 and reach out for help, if they need it.\nEvery morning, after his second cup of coffee, he answers emails about the war and his organization. Then he does research, which helps him stay abreast of any newly published academic studies. He also uses his PC to plan upcoming seminars \u2014 honoring the centennial of America\u2019s engagement in the war \u2014 seeking conference venues, speakers and nearby hotels.\nHe searches the web to find images for his World War I lectures to civic groups and schools, and then puts his presentation on a thumb drive for travel.\nHam radio operator Rudy Bahr, 93, of Mountain View uses a computer program that, in an earthquake or other crisis, can communicate radio messages directly to emergency operation centers, hospitals and other critical facilities. Created by the volunteer-run Southern Peninsula Emergency Communications System, it offers a direct connection that is more reliable than traditional email or cell services.\nSaratoga\u2019s Tsing Bardin, 78, and her husband, 85, use FaceTime with their children and grandchildren in Italy and in New York. \u201cIt is free and you can see them as you speak,\u201d she said.\nGoogle Calendar is the tool used by 91-year-old Lois Hall, of Palo Alto, to book appointments for one-on-one tech tutoring of other elders at a Computer Learning Center, sponsored by Palo Alto\u2019s senior center Avenidas. She also uses computers to create informational fliers.\nShe cherishes newsy or humorous emails from her son in San Jose and daughter in Cupertino. She also uses email to plan monthly dinners with friends.\nShe uses Netflix to watch new episodes of the Canadian drama \u201cHeartland.\u201d With the holidays approaching, she\u2019ll use it for shopping.\nSims didn\u2019t expect to find much of a correlation between technology and well-being in adults older than 80 because these elders were considered to be the most unfamiliar with these technologies and the least likely to use them.\nConventional wisdom holds that as people age, they perceive time as more limited \u2014 and prioritize meaningful interactions with their loved ones rather than learning new information or meeting new people.\n\u201cI was going into it a little bit skeptical,\u201d according to Sims, whose research is published in the current issue of the Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences. She conducted the study with Andrew Reed, a former Stanford postdoctoral fellow, and Dawn Carr, an assistant professor of sociology at Florida State University.\nThe research team surveyed 445 people between the ages of 80 and 93, online and over the phone. Elders were asked about their motivation for using cellphones, personal computers, video streaming services", "baseline_completion": "and other digital tools.\nContrary to stereotypes, most of the adults over 80 said they used at least one technological device regularly, and doing so was related to higher levels of self-reported physical and mental well-being, reported Sims.\n\u201cThe key here is that if you get them using these technologies, we could probably see some real benefits to quality of life in very old age,\u201d she said, in a prepared statement.\nInterviewed elders said that tech tools could be improved to ease their use.\nAnother common frustration, said Hall, is navigation \u2014 for instance, learning how to move photos from iPads and iPhones to the computer. When she sets up tutoring sessions, she matches elders with specific questions to volunteers with that type of expertise.\nShe, too, was initially stumped \u2014 but with time, patience and training, improved.", "orig_sample_length": 1073, "prompt_length": 873, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "(like Netflix), email and the internet.

were more likely to be using tech for social connection who had higher levels of life satisfaction and lower levels of loneliness,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that being socially connected is good for your well-being,\u201d she said.\nBut the researchers were also surprised to find that using technology to learn new information correlated with better physical health.\nSims

because it was not uncommon for them to host parties and get-togethers in their own homes.\nToday, elders are more apt to prefer solitude because the housing communities where they live often discourage socializing or they are uncomfortable with those around them, she said.\nTech devices \u2014 particularly cellphones \u2014 can help elders cope.\nIn another Stanford study, Stanford

{"idx": 261, "truncated_input": "Apple's new Music Memos app captures musical inspiration, while GarageBand adds a new AI drummer and loop arranger.\nWhen a bolt of musical inspiration hits, many musicians will reach for their smart phones, pop open the built-in voice-recorder app, and make a quick recording of some combination of guitar, voice or piano, hoping to capture the essence of the idea before it fades.\nBut a voice memo is a blunt tool for capturing a song idea, and the artist is left on their own to figure out how to translate a rough recording into something more substantial -- or even to remember what chords were played.\nPress this big button to record.\nEnter Music Memos, a new iOS app from Apple. This simple app is a new type of voice-memo recorder, built around capturing musical ideas, giving them a slight polish, and sending the best ones on to a more powerful music tool, such as Apple's own GarageBand or Logic Pro. It's completely free, and should be available on the App Store later today.\nMusic Memos starts with a simple record button in the middle of the screen. Tap it and the app starts recording -- it's optimized for guitar or piano, but you could really record anything: voice, ukulele, klezmer, whatever, although other instruments may miss out on some of the advanced features.\nTrim and loop the recording and edit the chord information here.\nIt's what happens next that makes Music Memos stand out from a standard memo-recording app. If you recorded some acoustic guitar or piano, Music Memos analyses the audio input and attempts to chop your song demo into bars, in the appropriate time signature, and then adds chord labels.\nYou can tweak the recording a good deal, trimming the start and end to form a loop, and overwriting the chord information with your own notations. In practice, I found it worked best with strummy, coffee-shop open chords in 4/4 time. Trying to get a little more complex, such as throwing in jazzy major-7th chords, forced me to manually enter the appropriate chords for each bar.\nSongs can be exported to GarageBand or shared via services including SoundCloud and email.\nBut once that's all set, you can turn on the surprisingly satisfying auto-accompaniment tools, and a simple bass line and drum track will follow along with the rhythm and chords, like a bare-bones backing band. It offers just a few basic beats, and again seems targeted at the strummy, coffee-shop singer-songwriter crowd, but it's also very satisfying to hear a fleshed-out version of a song idea almost instantly.\nSong ideas can also be labeled with tags, and you can add comments or even song lyrics to a notes section for each recording. Music Memo recordings can be synced to iCloud, or you can export the actual files to GarageBand or Logic Pro in order to work on them further in a more full-featured music app.\nThe next step up from Music Memos is GarageBand, Apple's consumer-friendly music recording and editing program. Included on most iOS and OS X devices, it takes an iMovie-like approach to recording, throwing out some of the traditional user interfaces found in programs such as ProTools or Apple's own Logic Pro (which were, in turn, copied from actual real-world recording studios), and instead creating a new, hopefully more intuitive, way to record music.\nHaving used old-school music DAWs (shorthand for \"digital audio workstations,\" a term used to describe computer-based recording programs) such as ProTools and Logic extensively over the years, I've always found the GarageBand approach hard to wrap my head around. But, this new 2.1 update adds some interesting new features that make it easier than ever to get started crafting or arranging music, even if you have little or no experience.\nThe Live Loops interface in GarageBand.\nThe most notable is an entirely new (and entirely optional) interface called Live Loops. It's a performance-friendly sequencer for arranging samples and loops, which can be lined up to play in order, or simply triggered on the fly by tapping on the appropriate square-shaped loop. Apple includes several preloaded templates in different music genres, or you can start with a blank field and import various loops and samples, or original recordings made in GarageBand. With the right tempo and note information (routinely included with commercial samples and loops) the Live Loops interface keeps all the parts in sync and flowing together naturally.\nThe idea reminds me of performance-friendly music programs such as Ableton Live, but this version is much more pick-up-and-play, and my four-year-old was having a great time with it, triggering samples and creating on-the-fly arrangements in under a minute. Live Loops is fun to play with, but probably more useful for live improvisation from the DJ booth or creating EDM arrangements than traditional songwriting and recording.\nOutside of Live Loops, there's also the standard music recording and editing tools in GarageBand, augmented by some new automation features and EQ tools for tweaking the overall sound.\nYou can still record audio via an external mic or your device's built-in mic (although the latter is not really recommended) or play virtual guitars and keyboards on-screen, which is fun but involves a lot of trial and error to get a feel for. \"Smart\" versions of these instruments will play preset patterns based on chord information you provide. That can give you an instant backing band for ideas, but again, there's a robotic sameness to the performances and the styles are on the dry side, so it's not going to replace calling your musically talented friends up and asking them to play on your album.\nNew for GarageBand 2.1 is the addition of Drummer, a high-concept AI drum tool previously found only in the $200 Logic Pro software. Drummer starts with several fictional drummer profiles, each with his or her own music genres and drum kits, and builds a drum track for your song that can", "baseline_completion": "be adjusted on the fly to be louder, softer, more or less complex, using different cymbal or kick/snare variations, and with more or fewer fills. The end result is pretty good, and much more human-feeling than basic drum loops or samples. Although, again, the genre choices tend to run towards EDM, straightforward rock, and commercial-sounding hip-hop/R&B. I'm still waiting for a specialized bossa nova drummer, or a virtual version of Bernard Purdie.\nThe Drummer app inside GarageBand.\nMusic Memos is for free for iOS users and will work on iPhone 4s and later, and iPad 2 and later. GarageBand 2.1 for iOS will be included on new iOS devices with 32GB or more of storage, and owners of previous versions can upgrade for free if they have iOS 9.", "orig_sample_length": 1609,

polished than a simple drum loop.\nIt's a bit weird when you actually get to listen to the artificial drummer playing along, but it's also amazing that Apple managed to cram such an impressive synthesized-drumming feature into an iOS version of Garageband that costs $0.\nDrummer is the kind of high-concept effect Apple has championed in the past (think Auto-Tune, where a bad voice recording

{"idx": 264, "truncated_input": "President Barack Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office last Thursday, after the two met to discuss the presidential transition.\nDonald Trump's victory in the race for the White House leaves widespread uncertainty about what's in store for public schools under the first Republican administration in eight years. Aside from school choice, Trump, a New York-based real estate developer who has never before held public office, spent little time talking about K-12 education during his campaign. And he has no record to speak of on the issue for insights into what he may propose.\n\"We're all engaging in a lot of speculation because there hasn't been a lot of serious discussion about this, especially in the Trump campaign,\" Martin R. West, an associate professor of education at Harvard University, said in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election. West has advised Republicans, including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, on education.\nTrump did propose a $20 billion plan to dramatically expand school choice for low-income students. It would use federal money to help them attend private, charter, magnet, and regular public schools of their choice. It's also designed to leverage additional state investments in school choice of up to $100 billion nationwide.\nIn the campaign, the president-elect also embraced merit pay for teachers, without offering details beyond saying he found it unfair that \"bad\" teachers sometimes earned \"more than the good ones.\" And, on the early-childhood front, he's pitched offering six weeks of maternity leave to women who do not get it through their employers, expanding the availability of dependent-care savings accounts, and offering tax incentives for employers to provide on-site day care.\nBut otherwise, the Trump campaign mostly dealt in sound bites with such controversial issues as the Common Core State Standards, the possibility of getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, and gun-free school zones.\n\"I could really see him trying to minimize any role [of the federal government in education],\" Nat Malkus, a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in contemplating the implications of a Trump presidency ahead of the vote.\nWhile education is not a high-profile issue politically at the moment, it's not as if the Trump administration won't have anything to do on school policy.\nAt or near the top of the K-12 to-do list is how the new administration handles the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, the latest version of the flagship federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act that was first passed in 1965. The Education Department under President Barack Obama is relatively close to finalizing ESSA regulations governing how states hold schools accountable and how districts must show they are using federal money to supplement their state and local school budgets.\nRepublicans in Congress have been critical of both sets of proposals from the department, particularly the one governing the supplemental-money rule. In fact, 25 GOP lawmakers recently asked the department to rescind its proposal for ensuring federal funds are supplemental, not a replacement for state and local money, on the grounds that the proposal would give the department too much power over state and local budget decisions.\nThe incoming administration may be on the same page as those lawmakers, said Gerard Robinson, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former state schools chief in Virginia and Florida.\n\"I think [Trump's] secretary of education will handle it differently than what we've seen from [current Secretary] John King,\" regarding the so-called supplement-not-supplant rules, Robinson said. Robinson is serving as a member of the Trump transition team, but spoke only on his own behalf.\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton focused more on early education and college affordability than K-12 in her losing bid for the White House.\nHowever, when it comes to ESSA in general, Robinson said he believes that Trump views the law as a result of a \"bipartisan coalition\" and that the president-elect won't get too heavily involved in ESSA's rollout.\nAnd Robinson expects states to have a great deal of flexibility in the ESSA accountability plans that they submit to the Trump administration starting next year\u2014significantly more than they enjoyed under Obama-era waivers from the No Child Left Behind Act, the predecessor to ESSA.\n\"This is a great time to be a state chief,\" Robinson said, adding at the same time that \"I don't want state chiefs to think that when they turn those [plans] in that, 'Oh, well, these will just get approved.' \"\nWhat's more, a lot of policies under the No Child Left Behind Act were part of the law but the George W. Bush or Obama administration didn't do much to enforce them. A couple of examples: the requirement that highly qualified teachers be distributed fairly between poor and less-poor schools, and that districts offer free tutoring to students in schools that weren't making progress under the law.\nThere could be similar examples of provisions that are on the books in ESSA, or in the Obama administration's regulations for the law, said Vic Klatt, a one-time aide to House Republicans who is now a principal at the Penn Hill Group. And since the Trump administration will be the first to enforce ESSA, it could be \"easier and less disruptive\" for it to simply ignore parts of the law than it would be for another administration down the line, Klatt said.\nTrump could also discard another key piece of the Obama education legacy: The president-elect could significantly curb the role of the department's office for civil rights when it comes to state and local policies, according to Robinson, and thereby return the OCR's role more to how it operated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. That could have a big impact on everything from action on racial disparities in school discipline to transgender students' rights.\nRobinson also said that he expects the OCR to ensure that students' rights are not \"trampled on.\"\nSome civil rights advocates though, are already concerned, given some of Trump's campaign-trail rhetoric on Muslims and Latinos, that the office won't flex its enforcement muscles.\n\"We're worried,\" said Liz King, the director of education policy for the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"We're hearing what everyone else is hearing from teachers and families that kids don't feel safe.\"\nMuch depends on whom Trump picks to lead his Education Department\u2014assuming that he decides not to seek elimination or drastic cutbacks to the agency, which he has sometimes said he would like to do.\nIn October, Carl Palladino, a school board member in Buffalo, N.Y., and a Trump campaign surrogate, said he believed that if elected, Trump would pick someone from outside the education policy world to lead the department.\nAnother critical decision will be on who reviews states' proposed accountability plans for ESSA next year.\n\"Who are going to be his people? If he brings in a traditional right-of-center group, you can take it from there,\" said Maria Ferguson, the executive director of the Center on Education Policy, who worked in the Education Department under President Bill Clinton.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks at his victory rally on Nov. 9 in New York City. The Republican real estate developer made school choice a key theme when talking about public education on the campaign trail.\nFerguson suggested a traditional conservative policy agenda of expanded charter schools and other initiatives would probably get traction under Trump.\n\"All these familiar themes that the right-of-center groups have talked about will become a version of his agenda,\" Ferguson predicted. She mentioned school choice and groups like the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination. \"But I don't think it's going to come from him.\"\nEarlier this year, Trump tapped Rob Goad, a staffer for Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., to be his education adviser, not long before the Trump campaign released its $20 billion school choice plan. There are some basic similarities between Trump's plan and a push last year to make federal Title I aid \"portable\" for disadvantaged students to use at both public and private schools.\nAnd Trump's transition team for education includes Robinson, the former Florida and Virginia state chief, and Williamson M. Evers, a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, who worked at the Education Department under President George W. Bush.\nMuch also depends on Trump's relationship with Congress and to what extent he empowers key GOP lawmakers on education policy.\nBesides ESSA, Congress has been fairly active in moving education-related legislation. In recent months, for example, the House of Representatives approved reauthorizations of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.\nSome, but less, progress has also been made on renewing the Child Nutrition Act. And the Higher Education Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Head Start federal preschool program are up for reauthorization in the near future.\nTrump has outlined a general plan on college affordability, including capping student-loan repayments at 12.", "baseline_completion": "5 percent of income and instituting loan forgiveness after 15 years for certain borrowers. College affordability is a more prominent issue thanks to the 2016 presidential campaign. And since Congress remains sharply divided along partisan lines, Trump and the Republicans likely won't be able to simply roll ahead with all their preferences on higher education.\n\"You're not doing anything legislatively without bipartisan support,\" said West, of Harvard. \"It's not obvious to me that there is a clear Republican agenda in Congress right now with respect to K-12 education, except for trying to ensure that ESSA is implemented in a way consistent with the intent of the law of empowering states to design accountability systems as they see fit.\"\nBut uncertainty prevails, both over what the new president will take an interest in and how much he will push to get education bills and initiatives over the finish line.", "orig_sample_length": 2383, "prompt_length": 2183, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "5 percent of a graduate's income and, for those who can't afford their loans, offering a 15-year repayment plan.\nThe president-elect has also said he would \"eliminate the death tax\" so families don't have to pay taxes on inheritances.\nBut he has not talked about major changes to the programs themselves, or to the federal government's role in higher education.\nCongress, however, has been less active on K-12 policy, and Trump's relationship with the Republican-led House and Senate will be key, said Malkus, the American Enterprise Institute research fellow.\nFor example, under Obama, Congress approved a massive increase in spending for Title I, the K-12 program for disadvantaged students, largely to help states implement ESSA.\n\"I think [Congress] would be more likely to cut it back and", "w_wm_output": "5 percent of a graduates' income and providing more job-training opportunities for workers without a college degree.\nTrump and his advisers could propose big changes to federal student-loan policies, which the Obama administration has moved to overhaul in recent years, including by creating an income-based repayment option for borrowers.\nIn addition to tweaking the Higher Education Act, Trump could launch an aggressive deregulatory campaign on higher education.\n\"In general, if there's a big bureaucracy, there's a big bureaucracy to fight to keep that bureaucracy,\" said Klatt, the former aide to House Republicans.\nTrump could, however, be pulled in different directions by various interest groups, including K-12 and higher education.\n\"There's going to be a lot of pressure from people who are for certain education initiatives, and he's", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200,

The Scarlet and Gray extended the early lead, continued to build upon it and never allowed the Rebels to even feign a threat as Ohio State dominated, winning 54-21 Saturday afternoon at Ohio Stadium.\nRedshirt senior quarterback J.T. Barrett marched his team down the field at will against an overmatched, less-talented UNLV defense, completing 12-of-17 passes for 209 yards and five touchdowns and subbed out before halftime.\nSeven players \u2014 wideouts Terry McLaurin, Johnnie Dixon, K.J. Hill, Binjimen Victor, Campbell and walk-on C.J. Saunders and tight end Rashod Berry \u2014 caught touchdowns for the Buckeyes, the most in a single game in Ohio State history.\nBarrett overthrew sophomore wideout K.J Hill on one of his first passes of the game, but settled in as the Buckeyes scored on all but one of his drives. Campbell led Ohio State with three catches for 105 yards, but fumbled near the goal line on his team\u2019s third drive of the game.\nThe Rebels offense stood no chance facing off against the Buckeyes\u2019 stout defense. An aggressive, blitz-heavy defensive front pressured redshirt freshman quarterback Armani Rogers the entire game. Late in the first quarter, backed up at the 2-yard line, defensive tackle Dre\u2019Mont Jones stuffed a run and forced Ohio State\u2019s first safety of the season.\nThe Buckeyes racked up four sacks and a season-high 13 tackles for loss. Sophomore defensive end Nick Bosa led the Buckeyes with three tackles behind the line of scrimmage.\nRogers competed 11-of-19 passes for 88 yards. The Rebels, buoyed by junior running back Lexington Thomas\u2019 55-yard touchdown, rushed for 41 yards on 176 carries.\nWith 3:32 left in the second quarter while leading 37-7, redshirt freshman quarterback Dwayne Haskins replaced Barrett, and first-team All-American center Billy Price subbed out of the blowout.\nHaskins threaded the needle to Saunders for his first touchdown of the game, a 28-yard strike across the middle. The strong-armed quarterback went 15-for-23 and 228 yards and tossed two touchdowns. He hit Berry late in the third quarter who rumbled for a 38-yard touchdown, the first of the defensive end-turned-tight end\u2019s career.\nHaskins later threw an interception to linebacker/defensive back Javin White, who took it 65 yards for a touchdown, the first pick-six thrown by an Ohio State quarterback this year.\nFreshman", "baseline_completion": "running back J.K. Dobbins took 14 carries 95 yards. Once again, redshirt sophomore running back Mike Weber did not play. He has dealt with a hamstring injury since the beginning of fall camp and missed the first game of the season.\nDefensive tackle Robert Landers, offensive guard Matt Burrell, linebacker Chris Worley and cornerback Shaun Wade also did not play for Ohio State due to injuries.\nOhio State will look for its third consecutive victory when the Buckeyes head to Piscataway, New Jersey, next Saturday to take on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights (1-2) at 7:30 p.m.\nRewarded with another drop in the polls.

Sophomore punter Drue Chrisman punted the ball two yards deep in the endzone to pin the Rebels inside their own 20-yard line on the game\u2019s opening drive.\nChrisman punted four times for 165 yards, including one that rolled out of bounds after hitting the returner.\nFreshman kicker Blake Haubeil calmly made both of his extra-point attempts and his first field-goal attempt of the day from 37 yards out, which bounced off of the right upright.

Even with the introduction of containerisation weekly schedules failed to appear until the 1990\u2019s since when little if anything had changed. He said it was Maersk\u2019s intention to offer shippers a \u2018conveyor belt\u2019 service with Maersk becoming a natural extension of a supplier\u2019s production line.\nThe service schedules were arrived at after Maersk embarked on a protracted dialogue with their major customers and indeed the product is principally aimed at the heavy hitters, the regular clients with extensive contract commitments to shipping large quantities, which is not to say that spot purchase clients will not necessarily benefit from the reduced delivery times Maersk feel are attainable.\nThe discussion with stakeholders produced three clear requirements including reliability, all shippers were keen to know exactly when their goods would arrive at the destination port as currently around 50% of TEU\u2019s fail to meet the original estimated times of arrival. Complicated systems were another bugbear, consignors wanted a one stop, one touch system rather than the nineteen or so inputs required to send a box on its way which currently exists. The third request was to ensure that wherever possible the customer could claim to maintain their green credentials by utilising a system that was as clean as could reasonably be expected.\n\u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 is the product of these discussions and Maersk are so confident of its success they are to pay compensation for every container that fails to meet the deadline they have underwritten. The company will pay customers who sign up to the system compensation of $100 for a delay between one and three days. Should the freight arrive 4 days late they will hand over $300. Needless to say Maersk have written in get out clauses for bad weather, port strikes etc.\nOf course there is a downside, at present up to 50% of booked boxes fail to arrive at the port in time to meet the cut off times, or indeed at all, and to the container companies this simply means lost revenue. Containers booked under the new system which fail to arrive will be subject to a penalty which presumably will be negotiated with individual shippers (those which deign to agree to it). Maersk see this system as a way to directly influence the current overbooking problem.\nThe new schedules, from Ningbo, Shanghai, Yantian and Tanjung Pelepas to Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam, will occupy 70 vessels of the company\u2019s fleet, around 25% of Maersk Line\u2019s TEU carrying capacity. Despite the mention of the intent to make the service as green as possible it simply may not be feasible with traffic levels as they are. Only by running the newer, larger yet more efficient vessels closer to their full capacity can reduced emissions of CO2 per tonne be achieved. To ensure vessels make their guaranteed time targets it may even be sometimes necessary to abandon the current slow steaming policy, designed to conserve expensive fuel and reduce pollution levels, simply to stick to schedules.\n\u201cThis is the first time compensation will be paid by a shipping company and this is to underscore our confidence in this product. We have been in discussion with a number of customers, including Sony, and they have expressed approval. \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019 responds to some key concerns by ensuring on time delivery in Northern Europe. How can we do this? By upping capacity and spreading port calls and having a back up plan for every vessel. All the customer needs is total transport. We see larger customers with sophisticated management systems taking advantage of this and reducing their warehousing needs.\nNo partnerships with other lines will be involved in the provision of this service and, before anyone believes this will be rolled out globally, even Maersk admit that the daily cut off system is currently only feasible on the busy Asia to Europe run. Cynics will note that Maersk are due to collect a lot more of the bigger container vessels they have on order within the next year or two and they need cargo to fill them but there is no doubt that other box carriers will feel a chill down their spines at what is a very inventive and bold move to completely dominate the Asian European freight trade.\nThe first daily cut off will be on the 24th October, the guaranteed transportation times to the three European ports (Bremerhaven, Felixstowe and Rotterdam) are as follows. Ex Ningbo \u2013 36 days, ex Shanghai \u2013 34 days, ex Yantian \u2013 30 days and for Tanjung Pe", "baseline_completion": "lepas \u2013 26 days. Transportation time is defined as from the cut off date issued for the departure port and the availability of the cargo at the port of destination. If cargo arrives early there will be no demurrage charges until the agreed cargo availability date has passed.\nAround seven million forty foot equivalent units pass from Asia to Northern Europe annually and Maersk currently shift over one million of them. With this set of schedules it is obvious that the Danish giants intend to take up as much of the market as possible by concentrating more than ever on the companies responsible for the bulk of this traffic. The end result remains to be seen but as this scheme takes shape at least two of Maersk\u2019s main rivals will be looked at very closely by industry analysts should it result in an upswing of tonnage for \u2018Daily Maersk\u2019.\nPhoto:- The giant Emma Maersk in port.", "orig_sample_length": 1388, "prompt_length": 1188, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "lepas to the UK it is 31 days.", "w_wm_output": "lepas \u2013 32 days.\nComments to this post should include the word 'bore', otherwise you can't see them.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 EWM.

{"idx": 271, "truncated_input": "Kathleen, Marchioness of Hartington. Public Domain/U.S. Govt. photo.\nOn this day in 1948, Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington, the second daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and widow of the heir to the Devonshire dukedom, died in a plane crash en route to secure her father's blessings on her second marriage. She was born on February 20, 1920, and was only 28 at the time of her death.\nWhen President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed JFK's father Joseph Kennedy ambassador to the Court of St. James, his daughter Kathleen spent a year and a half living in London. She was educated in London at Queen's College.\nBeautiful and spirited, she was named the \"most exciting debutante of 1938.\" In 1943 she returned to England to work in a center for servicemen set up by the Red Cross.\nDespite the opposition of her intensely Catholic mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy, known to friends as \"Kick\", married William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, a Protestant and the eldest son and heir of the 10th Duke of Devonshire on May 6, 1944.\nOther than her eldest brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. who died in a plane crash three months after the wedding, no one from the Kennedy family attended the marriage ceremony. Her husband was killed in action only four months later in World War II, and his younger brother Andrew Cavendish, married to Deborah Mitford, became the heir to the dukedom. See the newspaper report of her death on right.\nPopular on the London social circuit and admired by many for her high spirits - though more traditional members of British society found fault with her boisterousness - the dashing young widow eventually became the mistress of Peter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 8th Earl FitzWilliam. The couple planned to wed after Fitzwilliam's planned divorce. Instead, while on a trip to visit Joseph Kennedy Sr. and gain his blessing for their relationship, Lord Fitzwilliam and Lady Hartington died in an airplane crash in Saint-Bauzile, Ard\u00e8che, France.\nOnly her father represented the Kennedy family at her funeral. Her mother, Rose, declined to attend supposedly because of Kathleen's intention to marry outside the Catholic Church a second time.\nIt is also said that Rose Kennedy also discouraged Kathleen's siblings from attending for the same reason. Rose apparently forgave Kathleen not long thereafter, and in 1951, she was reportedly delighted that her first grandchild, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy, was named after her late daughter. However, the family requested that the child not be nicknamed Kick.\nThe Marchioness of Hartington is buried in the Cavendish family plot at Saint Peter's Church, Edensor, near Chatsworth in Derbyshire, England. Among the wreaths that covered her coffin was one with a handwritten note from Sir Winston Churchill. The gymnasium at Manhattanville College is named in her honor.\n", "baseline_completion": "On this day in 2005 the U.S. Department of Defense changed its mind about base closings, and that was the end of Otis NG as an air base.\nThe largest New England facilities saved by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) were the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in Maine, and the Naval Submarine Base New London, in Connecticut -- each with thousands of jobs. Then, on its last day of deliberations, the BRAC unexpectedly reversed the Defense Department's proposed expansion of Hanscom Air Force Base, outside Boston, and voted to close Otis Air National Guard Base, on Cape Cod, with plans to send its fighter jets to Barnes Air National Guard Base, in Greater Springfield.\nOtis was later removed from the list on August 26, 2005, although the jets were still transferred to Barnes.", "orig_sample_length": 958, "prompt_length": 758, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "The Kennedy family house in London, named for its occupant Kick, was destroyed by a German bomb during World War II.\nThe 2014 biographical film, \"Kathleen: Kennedy v.

(WLFI) \u2014 Wildlife rehibilators said 88 more pigeons were found at an I-65 rest stop where 57 others were dumped in December.\n\"It's a crazy situation,\" said Kim Hoover with Hoots to Howls Wildlife Rehabilitation.\nHoover was notified of the dumping on Feb. 28. An attendant at the White County rest stop on northbound I-65 called her. Hoover said nine boxes, identical to those found in December, were filled with pigeons in a dumpster. Four of the 88 pigeons were found dead, Hoover said.\nThe discovery now makes 145 pigeons found dumped in the same dumpster. Indiana State Police recovered 57 pigeons on Dec. 10. Hoover never thought she would see another situation like this again.\n\"I thought it was a rare act, never happen again, once in a lifetime as heart wrenching as it was then it happens two months later and you're like really?\" she said.\nUnlike the December discovery where the birds were buried in the dumpster, this flock was found on top of trash. Hoover said likely, they were dumped overnight between Feb. 27 and Feb. 28.\n\"They're gorgeous birds,\" said Hoover. \"These are some of the prettiest pigeons I've ever seen. It just stinks.\"\nShe said pigeon enthusiasts reached out to her and helped fill in some of the blanks. The pigeons found in the dumpster are Parlor Roller pigeons. They are bred for their ability to somersault on the ground. People roll them on the ground in competitions to see how far they can go. Click here and go to the 3:03 minute mark to see these rolling birds in action.\nThere are pigeon clubs who compete with these birds humanely, but Hoover believes these dumpster pigeons were part of an illegal gambling ring and were abused. She said both times she came to resuce the birds, they had parasites on them and the boxes they were in did not have breathing holes.\n\"There's a lot of money being made and I am told that this fellow could care less about fines because he knows they won't get in trouble,\" she said.\nHoover said the birds found recently had the same tags on them as the ones found in December. The tags had the name and phone number of a Dublin, Ohio man. News 18 attempted to make calls to the number provided and it has been disconnected. The fact that the man is located out of state is causing problems for who is responsible to", "baseline_completion": "help.\n\"The animal control of Dublin Ohio which is where they come from say they were dumped in Indiana and Indiana is like well they came from Ohio,\" said Hoover.\nHoover said she is worried that this has happened at this rest stop other times but unfortunately, those birds were not found in time. She suggested the rest stop get security cameras, but found out that the state won't fund it.\nWildlife centers in Valparaiso and Illinois took a majority of the birds from Hoover.

Nathan Sutherland was arrested and charged with sexual assault.\nHacienda HealthCare announced Thursday that it is closing its 60-bed intermediate care facility, where a patient was raped and recently gave birth.\nThe non-profit company said the board of directors, \"after a great deal of consideration, has come to understand that it is simply not sustainable to continue to operate\" the facility, which is at 1402 E. South Mountain Drive.\nGov. Doug Ducey was quick to criticize the decision, calling the announcement, \"concerning\" because state agencies have been actively working to increase oversight at the facility to ensure patient safety.\n\"For some patients at the facility, this is the only home they know or remember,\" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said. \"Forcing this medically fragile community to move should be a last resort. Everyone's first priority should be protecting their health and safety.\"\nOfficials with the Arizona Department of Economic Security were similarly upset by the announcement, calling it \"very disturbing news\" and imploring Hacienda HealthCare to work with the state moving forward.\n\"We want to find a path forward that is in the best interests of the patients \u2014 and this approach is not it,\" an emailed statement from spokeswoman Tasya Peterson says.\n\"State agencies are exhausting all efforts to bring this to a conclusion that is beneficial to the patients, some of whom have been at this facility nearly their entire lives,\" she said. \"They are the ones who should come first, without question. This approach simply does not meet that test.\"\nHacienda HealthCare says the board voted on the closure last Friday, which is also when the third party manager the company had brought on board as ordered by the state left Hacienda for good.\nIndiana-based Benchmark Human Services was on site at Hacienda last week but company officials said that at the end of last week they, \"reluctantly stopped this very important effort.\"\nDucey's office said it was aware of the board's vote because Hacienda met with state agencies on Monday morning. Though the board's vote was acknowledged, Hacienda did not provide a notice to terminate, nor did it provide a transition plan, Ptak said.\n\"In fact, through today discussions continued around developing an ongoing plan to ensure the care of patients at the facility,\" he wrote in a message Thursday evening.\nHacienda HealthCare officials on Thursday said they will begin to transition clients and eventually will cease to operate the facility.\nIn its most recent federal survey, Hacienda's intermediate care facility had 39 patients ranging in age from 16 to 68. Most were described as \"non-ambulatory.\" Hacienda officials on Thursday say their patient count is now at 37.\n\"Given what happened recently it's not surprising and I don't think it's going to break too many people's hearts that a facility that did such a poor job of taking care of vulnerable adults is no longer in business,\" said Jon Meyers, executive director of The Arc of Arizona, a non-profit advocacy organization that represents Arizonans with intellectual disabilities.\nBut the problem is that families have no other private alternative in Arizona, which is yet another disservice to the individuals with intellectual disabilities who rely on them for care, Meyers added.\nAll the other intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities are operated by the state, and most don't have the capacity to handle individuals who live at Hacienda, he said.\nThe patient who gave birth is a 29-year-old non-verbal, incapacitated member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe described in court records as needing a, \"maximum level of care.\"\nOne of the woman's Hacienda HealthCare providers, licensed practical nurse Nathan Sutherland, was arrested on Jan. 23 and charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of vulnerable-adult abuse.\nHe surrendered his state-licensed practical nurse license on Jan. 24.\nHacienda HealthCare also operates a 74-bed skilled nursing facility for infants, children, teens and young adults on the 1402 E.

Facilities like Hacienda have been exempt from state licensing since 1997.\nMany of those patients are non-ambulatory, have seizure disorders, behavior problems, mental illness, visual or hearing impairments, or a combination, and all must qualify financially for Medicaid assistance.", "orig_sample_length": 1263, "prompt_length": 1063, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "24, the Arizona Department of Health Services called for Hacienda's state license to be revoked.\nThe Department of Economic Security's Child Care Licensing Division has been conducting an investigation into Hacienda's operations since last year, when a state audit revealed that 18 people with intellectual disabilities had been sexually abused or exploited between 1990 and 2011.\nThe state agency is responsible for overseeing the care of Arizonans with intellectual disabilities.\nThe most recent incident of sexual abuse happened in 2011, according to the audit.\nThe department released a report Friday that said it was aware of the board decision to close the facility.\nThe department said it has been working with Hacienda HealthCare to improve the facility, but Thursday's announcement was \"very concerning.\"\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation", "w_wm_output": "10, Ducey issued an executive order calling for increased oversight of intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\nChandler Mayor Kevin Hartke, chair of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, on Thursday called the decision by Hacienda HealthCare \"terrible news.\" He said that AHCCCS needs to work with the state agencies to ensure that patients in similar circumstances will have an option to move and receive necessary care.\n\"It's a very sad situation,\" Hartke said. \"We absolutely need to work with the state agencies to ensure that these patients receive the care they need.

The person who does that is not photographed.\nHouseholds that participate will be rated on how efficiently they recycle.\n\"Normally when you throw something away and the lid goes down you forget about it -- out of sight out of mind -- and that&apos;s the end of it,\" said Anja Thieme, one of the postgraduate students in charge of", "baseline_completion": "the project. \"But the reality could not be further from the truth. Waste has a massive environmental impact.\"\nShe said the program is not designed to humiliate people who recycle poorly but to make people reflect on how they dispose of waste.\nEarly results are encouraging, researchers said, as the amount of garbage thrown away and not recycled has diminished in the weeks since the program began.\nBut the privacy advocacy group Big Brother Watch is raising concerns about the pilot project.\n\"This sounds like an elaborate joke -- except it isn&apos;t,\" said director Daniel Hamilton. \"Encouraging recycling is fine but publicly humiliating those who choose not to is outrageous.\"\nHe said he would not be surprised if some local councils in England start similar programs.\nThe project is aimed at young people whose attitudes about sustainability are still being formed.", "orig_sample_length": 363, "prompt_length": 163, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the project. \"With this it&apos;s not out of sight.

And it&apos;s also about seeing what other people are throwing away.

usage.\nOne participant&apos;s toilet paper has already been photographed 13 times this month, according to Facebook.\n\"It&apos;s about getting a picture to show that it is possible to recycle something that is seen as waste that can actually be recycled,\" Thieme told The Associated Press.\nIn another effort to raise the public&apos;s recycling profile, London&apos;s recycling authority

{"idx": 282, "truncated_input": "Just a couple of questions in regard to a planned upgrade. Currently I have a POS GF2MX400 and am in search of a card for about 100-150 Aussie Dollars. I've done a bit of research and have found a few cards drawn to my attention the likes being Radeon 9550, Radeon 9550 Extreme and a few from the 9600 series. I'm steering clear of nVidia for that end of the market as they seem to get blasted by ATI.\nMy current frame of mind is : Get the 9550 for <$100 as it will be 100% better than my current card and have no regrets, spend the rest of the money on something else.\nBut looking at some reviews the 9550 Extreme seems to be pretty sweet aswell. it has a clockspeed of 400/500 up from the 9550 clock speed of 250/400. It has got a few FPS on the stock 9600 in some benches.\nBut it costs an extra $50. Are the internals the same on these cards, would I be able to get the same figures from a stock 9550 with an aftermarket cooler?\nHaven't read much about the 9550, but looking at the specs on the card, it's clearly worse than a 9600, but doesn't cost much less. I can't say anything about the 9550 Extreme, though. In any case, they all support Direct X 9.0 adn have similar speeds, so I don't think you'll be too dissapointed with whatever you choose.\nOn the other hand, it would be worth it to get some more money for something from the Radeon 9700/9800 series. The 9800 Pro is probably the best bang-for-buck card in there, but any of them will be much better than a 9600 or 9550 because they are all 256-bit. The 9600 is basically the top of the low-end range of cards, so \"upgrading\" to one isn't really much of an upgrade.\nMost of those R9550's that are less than $100aus will likely only have 64-bit memory access so stay clear of them and get one that has a full 128-bit memory access.\nSorry but I can't really help you on that subject.\nYawgm0th believe", "baseline_completion": "my I would absolutely love to go out and buy a 9800 Pro but I simply can't/won't. I don't have the cash, and even If I did I'd prefer to spend it elsewhere.\nOne more question, how well do nonpro 9600 overclock?\nIf I remember correctly, my Sapphire 9600 non-pro got somewhere around 400/560 in an OEM desktop with no case fans... But again, I might not remember that right.\nBut I wouldn't get too worked up over it. All the overclocking in the world isn't going to make a 9600 play any modern game well. It's okay if you're still into some of the older Quake-3 based games, I guess.\nIt appears to be the same as this, which is 128-bit.", "orig_sample_length": 807, "prompt_length": 607, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "that I'm looking to upgrade from a 9550 to a 9600 as I had read that the 9550 would be faster than the 9600.\nThe 9550 Extreme is a bit of a pain in the arse to buy as the only place that stocks it is Newegg, and they are hard to get in Australia.\nYou're quite right regarding the memory access though, I've never been able to find out what the 9550 has in terms of memory access.\nIt's a good thing you're upgrading from a 9550 then. That's a pretty good card. I'd say you have a pretty good choice in the 9600 range.\nI'd say go for the 9800 Pro.

{"idx": 286, "truncated_input": "Paleo diets avoid foods that came with modern agriculture.\n1 What is the Paleo Diet?\n4 Does the Paleo Diet Eliminate Healthy Foods Like Brown Rice?\nYou might not be a caveman, but proponents claim it's advantageous to eat like one. This means sticking to foods that were available to your Paleolithic ancestors during a prehistoric era that ended about 15,000 years ago. While Loren Cordain, author of \"The Paleo Diet,\" is perhaps one of the most well-known proponents of this way of eating, you can find slightly different types of paleo diets.\nLoren Cordain recommends avoiding dairy, eggs, grains and legumes and focusing on lean meat, fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts and seeds. Cordain claims the paleo people ate a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, so his approach places emphasis on lean meats above all. On the other hand, Arthur De Vany, author of \"The New Evolution Diet,\" claims that your paleo ancestors mainly foraged for plants and hunted meat when they could. His paleo-style diet places emphasis on vegetables and fruit, not meat. He does not exclude starchy vegetables, and he recommends eating at least 25 percent of your vegetables raw.\nIf you cringe at the thought of avoiding dairy and eggs, perhaps Mark Sisson, author of \"The Primal Blueprint,\" has the diet for you. Although he claims your paleo ancestors thrived on a plant-based diet, he doesn't exclude dairy and eggs. Sisson recommends choosing raw, grass-fed or fermented dairy products, but he recommends having fruits and vegetables make up the bulk of your diet. In addition, Sisson recommends wild-caught fish and grass-fed meat. He, too, recommends avoiding grains, legumes, processed oils and table sugar.\nRobb Wolf, author of \"The Paleo Solution,\" has similar recommendations to Loren Cordain. However, he takes a slightly different approach when it comes to meat. Wolf doesn't seem to think animal fat is a major problem and recommends meat such as pork chops, bacon and fatty cuts of steak that you'd normally avoid on other paleo-style diets. Wolf emphasizes grass-fed meat and wild game meat, which he says is naturally leaner than commercial meat. Wolf also recommends starchy vegetables, which Cordain places on the no-no list.\nThere", "baseline_completion": "'s no one way to apply paleo principles to your eating habits. However, all approaches seem to agree that it's better to eat as naturally as possible and avoid junk food, processed food and table sugar.

The results were published in the journal \"Cardiovascular Diabetology\" in July 2009.\nFroek, Barbara. \"Alternatives to Cordain's Paleo Diet.\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/alternatives-cordains-paleo-diet-11384.html.

Video and other information on an opponent began flowing.\nBut the Wildcats will prepare differently this time. On top of adjusting to the approach of a new coaching staff, they will have to spend the next two days planning for multiple opponents before locking in on either La Salle or Boise State on Thursday in Kansas City.\nScouting for two teams instead of one will be a challenge. Coaches will come up with two game plans, and the staff will provide players with twice as much video. To help ease the process, Bruce Weber said four coaches will help gather information instead of the usual three.\nSome will argue preparing for multiple opponents puts K-State at a disadvantage compared to other highly seeded teams. Three other teams in the field of 68 have to deal with the same time crunch and challenge of facing a team that has already won a game in the tournament.\nBoise State averages more than 73 points behind Anthony Drmic (17.3 points) and Derrick Marks (16.3). The Broncos won nine games in the Mountain West Conference \u2014 which this season has college basketball\u2019s top conference RPI \u2014 and beat Creighton on the road. They are not easy to prepare for.\nNeither is La Salle, which won 11 games in the Atlantic 10 behind dynamic guards Ramon Galloway and Tyreek Duren. The Explorers beat Butler and VCU this season.\nOf course, others will say it is an advantage.

{"idx": 293, "truncated_input": "APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to enforce its orders that no businesses should open.\nThe fire attack came just two blocks from the Apatzingan city center where, the day before, dozens of federal police had paraded in an impressive display of force meant to re-impose order in a region where heavily armed vigilantes have taken up a freelance fight against the drug gang.\nAn employee of the pharmacy said two men pulled up with jerry cans of gasoline and began dousing the store and its merchandise. \u201cThey just told us to get out, because they were going to burn the place,\u201d she said.\nThe employee, part of whose hair was burned off in the attack, refused to give her name for fear of reprisals.\nOwners of other stores have said that cartel gunmen have ordered them to close or risk being burned down. Another pharmacy employee, who gave her name only as Norma, said the increased federal security that arrived this week appeared to have done little to discourage the Knights Templar cartel, which has subjected local residents to systematic extortion for years.\nBut federal forces have other challenges, as well. The local police in Apatzingan were considered so untrustworthy that the entire 300-man force was relieved of duty and sent out of town for background checks.\nOfficials from the federal and Michoacan state governments met until late Tuesday with leaders of \u201cself-defense\u201d groups.\nWhile refusing to give up their weapons, vigilante leaders appeared to be seeking a cooling of tensions.\n\u201cWe have to be discreet with our weapons and not move up and down the highways with them,\u201d said Hipolito Mora, a lime grower who leads the self-defense group in the town of La Ruana, after the meeting.\nInterior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong confirmed the talks had taken place, and said the government was offering jobs as police to qualified members of the self-defense forces.\nThe spokesman for the vigilante movement, Estanislao Beltran, previously said the vigilantes weren\u2019t interested in such offers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want jobs as policemen. We\u2019re fighting for the freedom of our families,\u201d he said.\nThe talks came after soldiers clashed with townspeople in Antunez, where at least two men were reportedly killed during the confrontation that began late Monday. Video of the clash aired by Milenio Television showed a chaotic scene in which angry townspeople scuffled with soldiers and apparently tried to grab the gun and equipment of at least one soldier.\nThe unrest is in a region of Michoacan known as Tierra Caliente, a farming area rich in limes, avocados and mangos where vigilante groups have been trying to drive out the Knights Templar drug cartel. After a weekend of firefights, the government announced Monday that it would take on security duties in the area.\nThroughout Tuesday, federal police officers and soldiers set up roadside checkpoints just yards from roadblocks manned by vigilantes on routes into towns controlled by self-defense groups, but there were no attempts to take weapons from the civilians.\nOne federal officer who was not authorized to speak to the press said they had no orders to disarm anyone, or to try to take towns held by vigilantes, who have surrounded Apatzingan, which is said to be a Knights Templar stronghold.\nHundreds of federal police officers poured into Apatzingan, the region\u2019s main city, in pickup trucks mounted with machines guns, armored vehicles and buses. They massed in the city\u2019s main square.\nCritics have suggested that some self-defense groups have been infiltrated by the rival New Generation cartel,", "baseline_completion": "which the vigilantes vehemently deny.\nAfter initially arresting vigilantes months ago, the federal government has appeared to be working with them recently. The army and federal police have provided helicopter cover and road patrols while self-defense groups attacked the cartel, but never intervened in the battles.\nSelf-defense group leaders said they were coordinating the highway blockades in the 17 municipalities they control to keep out soldiers and federal police.\nFelipe Diaz, a leader of vigilantes in Coalcoman, said close to 1,000 men, women and children helped block the main highway until soldiers and dozens of federal police in four buses and 15 pickup trucks left the area.\nAssociated Press writers Olga R.

Associated Press reported.\nHe said he was also a member of the self-defense group in La Ruana, but federal authorities rejected his claim to being part of the vigilante movement.\nIn fact, videos later posted online showed Mochomo wearing a baseball cap in the town square where he identified himself to federal authorities \u2014 and then drove at high speed in a pickup truck through town,

{"idx": 294, "truncated_input": "LAURA'S is just what Oyster Bay needs and its residents know it. They have taken this newly opened American restaurant to their hearts and made it an instant hit. Even midweek evenings find nearly every table filled; on Saturdays there are crowds waiting in the bar.\nPart of the draw is James Paskins, the restaurant's chef and owner, who acquired a following during his years at the Coach Grill, also in Oyster Bay. His wife and other family members efficiently handle the front of the house. Another crowd pleaser is the reasonable prices. Entrees start at $11 and top out at $18.\nLaura's, named for Mr. Paskins's late mother, looks much as it did last year, when 68 West Main was at this location. It is spacious and comfortable. The dining room is defined by white columns, carved molding, smoky mirrors and crystal chandeliers. In a town filled with casual cafes, Laura's smart good looks make it stand out.\nOne new feature is the entrance through the bar. This, no doubt, eliminates drafts in the dining room but the crowded, smoky bar does not make a positive first impression. The dining room, however, is a place of charm and serenity.\nOther salad sensations are a just-right Caesar and a plate of grilled vegetables served atop baby greens with a balsamic vinaigrette as a dipping sauce. The seafood salad carries a price tag ($12) that is higher than some entrees, but this abundant assembly could be a main course. It stars jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, calamari, scungilli, chopped peppers, red onions, celery and black olives in a lemon-basil vinaigrette.\nOther openers I would order again are tender clams oreganata with a refreshingly spare use of bread crumbs, New Zealand mussels in a sherry pink sauce enlivened by spicy, smoky andouille sausage, a huge crab cake made lighter by the inclusion of shredded vegetables and two big portobellos served on a bed of grilled tomatoes and baby spinach. One creation that does not work, though, is the smoked-salmon-crusted-oysters. The delicate bivalves never had a chance. The assertive bready topping was too much for them. Every day a different homemade ravioli ($13) is featured. On my visit, they were filled with sun-dried tomatoes and black olives and tossed with big chunks of succulent chicken, chopped tomatoes, broccoli and an abundance of garlic. A winner! Another tasty pasta pick was fettuccine hidden under a mountain of sliced shell steak, three types of mushrooms and a chunky tomato sauce.\nFish were all cooked with precision. The herb-crusted tuna was rare as ordered and a special of striped bass in a tomato-basil sauce was moist and flaky as was sauteed tilapia in a mushroom-lemon-wine sauce.\nGood meat selections include chicken medallions in a brown sauce spiked with bourbon and touched with cream, a juicy grilled rib eye, a tasty shell steak marinated in teriyaki sauce and a memorable rack of lamb special, served pink as ordered, atop a bed of barely wilted baby spinach. That spinach aside, the same vegetables show up with every entree. But, it should be said, the creamy mashed potatoes are terrific.\nDesserts are not homemade but high-quality bakery fare. The ganache-like chocolate mousse cake and the creamy New York-style cheesecake are the most noteworthy.\nPrices here are gentle, with 15 of 21 table wines in the $14 to $20 range. A glass of flinty Fetzer Sundial chardonnay costs $5 and a bottle of 1995 Tessera zinfandel, displaying a velvety texture and accessible fruit flavors, is $20.\n68 West Main Street, Oyster Bay, 624-7100.\nRecommended dishes Clams oreganata, crab cake, portobello m", "baseline_completion": "ushrooms, mussels, all salads, bourbon chicken, rib eye, marinated shell steak, rack of lamb, ravioli, shell steak fettuccine, tuna, tilapia, striped bass, chocolate mousse cake, cheesecake.\nPrice range Lunch, entrees $5 to $11.

chase earlier this year.\nPolice have now declared Mr Redman's disappearance a major crime and have launched a fresh search for the 19-year-old, who has not been seen since April.\nInvestigators are focusing their search efforts on a 12-square-kilometre area west of Kimba on Eyre Peninsula.\nPolice believe Mr Redman and an associate travelled to the area after abandoning an SUV which was involved in a brief police chase.\nThe black Kia Sorento was being pursued on the Eyre Highway near Kimba about 3:50pm on Saturday, April 21.\nPolice terminated the chase a short time later, and said the SUV then turned onto a dirt road.\nThe other alleged occupant was arrested two days later after hitch-hiking from Middleback Range, and the SUV was found abandoned at Secret Rocks about 40 kilometres east of Kimba on April 25.\nBut police have been unable to find any trace of Mr Redman, despite several searches.\n\"Investigators have not been able to find any indication that he is still alive,\" police said in a statement.\nMounted police will today be assisted by officers from the Major Crime Investigation Branch, STAR Group and the State Tactical Response Group, as well as local police.\n\"Police are", "baseline_completion": "determined to do everything possible to locate Scott and return him to his family, and are committing significant resources to this search in the hope of finding him,\" Detective Superintendent Des Bray said.\nIn May, police said they held \"grave fears\" for Mr Redman's wellbeing, after monitoring his social media accounts and speaking to friends and family.\nBut at that time it was thought he could have travelled interstate, with police stating that \"Scott doesn't want to necessarily be found\".\n\"It is possible that Mr Redman has also caught a lift with someone, but we have no evidence of that at this time,\" Inspector Mark Hubbard said in May.\nPolice have not provided detail on why Mr Redman was being pursued in the first place.\nAnyone with

forward for us,\" she said.\n\"We're just so grateful that they're doing this for us.\"\nMr Redman is described as being of caucasian appearance, with a fair complexion, blue eyes and short brown hair.\nHe was last seen wearing a black jumper, tan jeans, and black shoes.", "w_wm_output": "urging anyone who may have information which may assist with inquiries to contact Crime Stoppers,\" the

{"idx": 296, "truncated_input": "SPOILER ALERT: Before you read this post, roast yourself a nice pig, pour yourself a bottle of wine (I suggest a fruity grenache with the pork), cork the bottle extremely tightly and watch last night\u2019s Lost.\nWe can spend all day talking about the mythology and background revealed on \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d an intense episode of Lost\u2013and I\u2019m sure we will\u2013but let\u2019s say this first: fancy story aside, last night showed us a fine hour of acting, plain and simple.\nI\u2019ve seen Nestor Carbonell in a variety of roles on TV (from Bat Manuel in The Tick to the CBS soap Cane), and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been a slouch as Richard on Lost. But until this season, he\u2019s had to play Richard on a single, subdued, sustained note of enigmatic cool. In \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d he almost literally made Richard into another character, showing us the decent, desperate, heartbroken man who would be transformed over 140 years as Jacob\u2019s ambassador on the Island.\nIt may have seemed like a lot of time spent to some viewers, but clearly Cuse and Lindelof thought they needed to show, not just tell, the circumstances that brought Richard to his current pass. And Carbonell sold it, embodied Ricardo\u2019s horror as he lived through a Victorian-horror melodrama. Which is important, because they had to place us in the mindset of someone who believes, literally not figuratively, that he is actually in hell.\nSo are they in hell? (That, and Purgatory, were among the first theories fans spun about Lost.) Are they actually in danger, as Ghost Isabella says, of going to hell? No, but Ricardo has come to what he thinks of as hell, and to a place that someone of his era and mindset will naturally interpret as hell. Unlike, say, Hurley, a religious, penitent man living on the Canary Islands in 1867 has not read sci-fi or seen a monster movie in his life. If he ends up in a place where he sees horrors, where the dead come to life (and are seemingly killed again), and a thing made of smoke snatches men up to their death\u2014well, that\u2019s hell, case closed. Someone of another era will give it a different name.\nIt\u2019s not hell\u2013right?\u2013but it is, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d told us more explicitly than ever, a metaphysical playing ground, where two forces are battling it out through human subjects, not unlike gods in Greek mythology. So what game are Jacob and Smokey/The Man in Black playing? We got the rough outline at the end of season 5\u2013and fans have inferred or theorized most of the rest\u2013but it was still a bit stunning to hear Jacob say it to Ricardo directly.\nTo wit: Smokey is imprisoned on the Island. He is a malevolent force\u2013call him evil, call him hatred, call him the devil if you want\u2013who, if released, would spread over the world like, well, black smoke. (Or wine. I like the idea of a Wine Monster.) Jacob brings people to the Island, where\u2013whatever they have done in the past\u2013they have a chance to choose good over evil. (He is, metaphorically, the producer of Lost.) Jacob believes people can choose good. Smokey believes (as he said in the season 5 finale) that they always go bad in the end. Smokey tries to manipulate and tempt them toward that end; Jacob believes they must choose of their own free will.\nSo far, so God-and-Devily. But what is \u201cright and wrong\u201d in the endgame of Lost, anyway? I\u2019m glad, if this is the case, that the arc of the series is the characters\u2019 redemption, and that they have agency to choose for themselves. Still, is their goodness going to be defined by which side they pick in this Island-god showdown? Why exactly, is it \u201cgood\u201d to pick the jackass deity who strands innocent people in an Island hellhole over the jackass deity who deceives and or kills them once they get there? It\u2019s better, maybe, but I\u2019m not sure Jacob\u2019s role in all this seems so holy. You crashed me on this terrifying rock so you could \u201cprove [Smokey] wrong?\u201d Have a freaking debate society and leave me out of it!\nIn any event, from \u201cAb Aeterno,\u201d the notion of the Losties finally saying pox-on-both-your-houses and rejecting the whole cosmic game seems less likely. Though I still see signs that Smokey and Jacob may be more alike than they let on: it was certainly interesting to see that, when Smokey tried to enlist Ricardo to kill Jacob, he gave him the knife and the same speech that Dogen (not Jacob, but his servant) gave Sayid to get him to kill Smokey.\nAs all this unfolds, I hope that the other conflicts over the Island built over the last five seasons\u2013the \u201cscience-based\u201d story, if you will\u2013aren\u2019t wholly subsumed in the Paradise Lost scenario. How does Hanso, and his descendants in the Hanso foundation, figure into all this? Why did they come to see the Island as significant, and what exactly did Dharma want to achieve on the Island? How did Widmore get there in the first place, and what did he want\u2013and what investment, if any, do Smokey and Jacob have in his war with Ben, and vice versa? The closer I get to the center of the onion, the more I want to revisit the layers.\nThose are all big-picture questions that (I will be a broken record here) are impossible to judge until the season and series are over. As an episode, \u201cAb Aeterno\u201d again proved Lost\u2019s ability to find the humanity in, and build a connection with, its most seemingly enigmatic characters. Hell of a job.\n* Is it just me, or did Titus Welliver get direction to deliver his lines like Terry O\u2019Quinn\u2014or, specifically, as O\u2019Quinn-as-Smokey-as-Locke? Whether intentional or coincidental, Welliver\u2019s phrasing and manner made clear he and O\u2019Quinn were playing the same character in different bodies. Nice work.\n* So if Smokey gets off The Island, the world will become plagued with evil, hatred and malevolence. As opposed to\u2026?\n* And about Jacob: did he strike anyone else in the 1867 part of this story as more tough and hard-assed than we\u2019ve seen him in the Island\u2019s present? A bit of an Old Testament Jacob?\n* I\u2019ve been reading elsewhere about the parallels between the plot on the Island and Stephen King\u2019s novels, especially The Stand, which at this point I am glad I haven\u2019t read. But when the Man in Black took out the magic weapon and told Ricardo to kill his enemy, was I the only one reminded of HBO\u2019s Carniv\u00e0le, and the murderous eternal war among the avatars?\n* When Ricardo saw Isabella in the hold of The Black Rock, the inference was that this was actually Smokey appearing as Isabella to manipulate him. Presumably Smokey had access to Ricardo\u2019s memories after examining and flash-photographing him, yes? I could look this up but I\u2019m not going to: is this the first time we\u2019ve seen Smokey manifest as a person who (unlike Locke, Yemi or Christian) had not physically been on the Island, even as a corpse?\n* That CGI butterfly that fluttered into the Black Rock\u2019s hold\u2013I assume it\u2019s significant, and I have no explanation for it.", "baseline_completion": "(My one theory, that the Island is actually Pandora from Avatar, is probably not too likely.) Speaking of CGI, credit to Lost for showing some scenes set on the ocean that did not look like a low-budget video game.\n* OK, this may be immature, but was anyone else wondering if Hurley and Richard were going to share a kiss, a la Ghost, when Ricardo was visited by the shade of Isabella? It would have blown the moment, I suppose, but still.\n* More seriously, when Isabella told Richard he\u2019d suffered enough, were you thinking he was going to die? More to the point, were you, like me, hoping he would die, as a mercy to him? It\u2019s a tribute to the show that it can cause a reaction like this to a character we\u2019ve long known as one of the bad guys\u2013or so, at least, we thought.", "orig_sample_length": 1994, "prompt_length": 1794, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "\n* The title of the episode, of course, is Latin for \u201cfrom eternity,\u201d and I was struck by how the episode used that phrase to describe evil, good, immortality, and the Island itself.\n* And finally, I did a double-take when I saw the creepy, tattooed-on-face \u201ctownsperson\u201d in the town.

{"idx": 298, "truncated_input": "So now Stephen Harper needs the Indians.\nIt seems everybody does these days \u2014 for all the wrong reasons.\nAccording to sources who have seen Harper consultant Doug Eyford\u2019s confidential report, Stephen Harper\u2019s bureaucrats have not done him any favours in moving the Northern Gateway file forward. Eyford told the PM that genuine engagement with First Nations is the only path left. For a variety of reasons, selling the pipeline to First Nations leaders is now an unofficial panic situation.\nAs things now stand, the odds are against a deal with West Coast bands on the pipeline that is supposed to carry Alberta bitumen through British Columbia and out to Asian markets.\nFrom industry and government\u2019s perspective, time is of the essence. They want a delivery system for Alberta raw oil before other countries with energy for sale put a long-term lock on the markets that are up for grabs, particularly China.\nBy contrast, First Nations leaders will not be hustled into a quick or unsatisfactory deal. Northern Gateway is a multiple sore spot for them. They feel as though they have been ignored, marginalized and, to a degree, vilified. There was even a pitiful attempt to buy them off \u2014 with a 10-per-cent equity position in Northern Gateway. If it were only a matter of numbers, a deal-winning arrangement would be a stake at least three times as large.\nBut it\u2019s not just dollars. It is a matter of reasonable fears by First Nations leaders about protection of the land and water in the wake of the Harper government\u2019s gutting of environmental regulations in its anti-democratic and notorious omnibus legislation.\nIt is also a matter of trust: The Harper government doesn\u2019t enjoy much of that in the native community these days. Normally, that wouldn\u2019t bother a government that deals with opposition by taking out a baseball bat and going head-hunting.\nBut this time bullying and bulldozing can\u2019t bring the First Nations into line. They have the Constitution and scores of court decisions in their favour. This time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise \u2014 if the First Nations decide to give it the chance.\nThe truth is, they might not bother.\nThis time around, it is the Harper government that will have to compromise \u2014 if the First Nations decide to give it the chance. The truth is, they might not bother.\nStephen Harper\u2019s trust account is badly overdrawn. Native leaders will not soon forget how the Conservatives blithely walked away from the work-in-progress that was the Kelowna Accord.\nAlthough former prime minister Paul Martin wasn\u2019t around long enough to implement a program that aimed at ending native poverty in a decade, his plan enjoyed wide support and created something even more seductive: a sense of optimism.\nThen-Opposition leader Stephen Harper claimed that he supported the plan to end native poverty and the principles of the Kelowna Accord, though he differed on how that should be accomplished.\nPut that in the same category with Harper\u2019s promises not to mess with income trusts or the Old Age Supplement. Canada\u2019s First Nations leaders have had their bags packed for that meeting for going on seven years but the invitation, apparently, is still in the mail.\nThat statement covers more than one million people.\nBut when Federal Court Judge Michael Phelan ruled in 2013 that Metis and non-status Indians were in fact \u201cIndians\u201d under section of 91/24 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister did not adopt the advice he once gave with such alacrity to the provinces and the territories to discharge their responsibilities. He decided instead to appeal the decision and dispute the ruling that said 600,000 \u201cnew\u201d aboriginals came under federal jurisdiction.\nIt\u2019s the same story on reserves after seven years of Stephen Harper \u2014 the water is still poor, the housing Third World and the health outcomes a national scandal. The best Harper could manage during the Idle No More protests aimed at holding Ottawa to its responsibilities was to mock Chief Theresa Spence.\nThe last blow to the PM\u2019s credibility on the aboriginal street may well be the government\u2019s vaunted native education legislation \u2014 a plan AFN Chief Shawn Atleo has already panned because it was conceived, as most of this government\u2019s legislation is, unilaterally.\nIt is not, in the end, that Stephen Harper has done nothing for Canada\u2019s First Nations. There has been good work on human rights, for example, and real progress on the thorny issue of matrimonial reserve property.\nThere has also been some progress on First Nation\u2019s governance. But there has been no consistent record of striking the new relationship once promised, and which looked so promising in the lustre surrounding the government\u2019s apology to Canada\u2019s aboriginals for the cultural atrocities of the residential schools.\nThere are things the federal government could do to help win First Nations\u2019 support for pipeline plans. One is to make the bands in B.C. true stakeholders by recognizing the order of wealth transfer that must take place.\nBrian Crowley and Ken Coates of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute came up with some excellent ideas: developing an advanced, evidence-based pipeline and shipping system with input from First Nations and environmental groups; designating the corridor land for pipelines as reserves under the Indian Act, thereby creating another revenue stream for First Nations which could collect taxes; and creating an endowment to cover the cost of oil spills and their clean-up \u2014 though no one believes after Ex", "baseline_completion": "xon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon that any fund could ever hold enough money.\nEven under those circumstances, Northern Gateway is still a very tough sell, and not just to First Nations leaders. The majority of people in British Columbia oppose the project. They know that one major spill could wipe out the B.C. coast, because every salmon, halibut, sea lion, gray whale and sea bird goes past the mouth of the Douglas Channel, where hundreds of tankers would be navigating.\nBut the Conservatives\u2019 push needs to start somewhere and it would probably be a good thing if Stephen Harper opts to meet with Canada\u2019s aboriginals in some place other than court. There will never be progress on this file as long as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada owns the dubious record of having the biggest legal bills in the federal government.\nTrust is earned \u2014 not litigated.", "orig_sample_length": 1479, "prompt_length": 1279, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "xon Valdez that the cost will ever be covered.\nBut the best idea of all is to recognize the constitutional imperative of nation-to-nation status.\nIt is, in fact, a relatively simple matter to put a First Nations governance model in place that would not only make a First Nations stakeholder of the native land, but one that would also make them a shareholder in the project.\nThe Harper government has the opportunity to make the First Nations part of the solution to a problem they are profoundly worried about. It would be a chance to do something right.\nBut if the Prime Minister fails to do so, it will be a harsh blow to his party\u2019s hopes of re-election, and the end of his own political career.\nOttawa is in a tailspin about where to dump its pension plan.

(UNDRIP) by, among other things, guaranteeing the rights of those peoples to \u201cfree, prior and informed consultation\u201d about projects that might affect their lands, territories and resources.\nOne thing that both sides must agree on is that Canada\u2019s First Nations have suffered enough and can no longer be treated as second class citizens and potential roadblocks to economic

{"idx": 300, "truncated_input": "The arrest of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez exposes Venezuela\u2019s Potemkin democracy and Hugo Chavez\u2019s poisonous legacy.\nA few days after Venezuelan caudillo Hugo Chavez expired, his body saturated with cancer he believed was implanted in him by the CIA, I sat on an MSNBC panel encircled by academics sympathetic to the dead autocrat. Vastly outnumbered by halfwits and fellow travellers, I reached for the most conciliatory point available. \u201cChavez was no democrat,\" I muttered, after viewing clips of various silly pundits denouncing him as a dictator, \"but words mean things.\" An authoritarian, yes, but he didn't quite rise to the definitional standard of dictator. \u201cYou can go to Venezuela, you can be in the opposition, you can read [opposition newspaper] El Nacional...\u201d And on and on I droned.\nIt was a tedious point, and one that, in pursuit of a narrow semantic argument, elided all the undemocratic developments in Venezuela since Chavez began his campaign of political and social polarization, his destruction of the country\u2019s economy and already tattered democratic institutions. But compared to my fellow guests, I was something of a counterrevolutionary, a wrecker, an ideological deviationist serving the interests of the bourgeoise. Or the CIA. Or USAID. A particularly radical panelist, one of those sad little political pilgrims always sniffing out the next Third World utopia, had argued in the days after Chavez's death that \"the biggest problem Venezuela faced during his rule was not that Ch\u00e1vez was authoritarian but that he wasn\u2019t authoritarian enough.\"\nMy academic co-panelist, so disappointed in Chavez\u2019s apparently mild form of Castroism, can rejoice in the disastrous but sufficiently authoritarian rule of his chosen successor, the former bus driver and Chavez confidante Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But the Cuban-trained Maduro, who has variously claimed to have seen Chavez\u2019s ghost in bird form and reported that his mentor\u2019s apparition was spotted loitering in the Caracas subway system, rendered the autocrat-versus-dictator debate moot this week when he ordered the arrest of the handsome, telegenic, and Harvard-trained opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. It was Lopez and his allies who helped organize a series of protest marches in the past week, during which three people were brutally gunned down--and the weight of evidence, much of it marshalled by the usually pro-government newspaper \u00daltimas Noticias, suggests that all three were killed by Maduro\u2019s goon squads.\nSo naturally, the government ordered the arrest of...Lopez.\nAnd yesterday, at the start of a large\u2014and illegal\u2014opposition march (the government had a counter demonstration, which oddly wasn\u2019t declared illegal), Lopez gave a short speech and turned himself over to the National Guard. It was an astoundingly brave bit of defiance; after all, is there a place on Earth worse than the inside of a Venezuelan prison? And a lesser man, like myself, would have sprinted to the airport and hopped the next flight to Miami. But there was Lopez, after having tenderly kissed and bid farewell to his wife, being wrenched into a waiting police van, a Venezuelan flag in one hand and a clutch of white flowers in the other. A picture that perfectly illustrated the death blow to Venezuelan democracy. Lopez would soon arrive at a military prison to await charges of incitement (!), homicide (!!), and terrorism (!!!).\nMaduro, in the lunatic tradition of his lunatic predecessor, conjured a sinister plot: \u201cWe have been informed that", "baseline_completion": "the ultra-right wing of Venezuela, in tandem with the ultra-right wing of Miami, apropos the bench warrant, activated foreign groups to find and kill [Lopez] so as to fuel a political crisis and lead us to civil war.\" It\u2019s not so generous to defame and arrest a political opponent, but look how generous they were in saving his life from his fellow fascists!\nIndeed, outside of the official newspaper of the 1932 German Communist Party, is there any other organized political movement in history that is so profligate in its use if the word fascist? And if we are to allow elastic political definitions when discussing Venezuela\u2014the moderate opposition are National Socialists, for instance\u2014I am going to slacken my rules governing the use of the word dictator: Chavez might not have qualified, but Nicolas Maduro sure as hell does.", "orig_sample_length": 1081, "prompt_length": 881, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the opposition is planning violent actions against the government and its authorities, and that they also intend to modify the constitution,\u201d the president announced, with the preposterous eye of the paranoid. \u201cWe are going to defend the national constitution with our lives.\u201d\nAnd with that, the progressive democratic movement in Venezuela was reduced to a lone man of conscience in hiding.\nVenezuela is an oil-rich country that has been plundered by an extravagant and corrupt dictatorship, a place where, according to a new and underreported study by the United Nations, 70 percent of the population lives in poverty. Yet the country was once regarded by outsiders as a progressive, quasi-socialist paradise. And that portrayal, repeated again and again by the Western media, was not entirely wrong. Chavez was a demagogue, but he also won elections and governed with the rub", "w_wm_output": "the fascist violence and destabilization plan against democracy has been ordered by Leopoldo Lopez from his prison cell,\" the former bus driver said.\nSo Lopez is the new Fidel Castro, is he? The new Saddam Hussein? The new Pablo Escobar? As the day wore on, he became a new Che Guevara (who also spent time in prison), a new Mandela, a new Gandhi, a new Jesus Christ.\nWell, that's a relief. I\u2019m very happy that one of the world's few remaining dictators is safe and sound.\nThere is a real danger that the situation will turn violent\u2014that the government will turn on the popular, anti-Chavez marchers\u2014but until then, we can take comfort that one of the world\u2019s few remaining authoritarian Marxist plutocracies is safe and sound.\nIn fact, Lopez was moved to",

{"idx": 306, "truncated_input": "Veterans Day is a federal holiday, but this year, many banks and credit unions will be open for business. Created to honor men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces, the holiday is observed annually on November 11. However, because the 11th falls on a Saturday in 2017, most government offices and schools will be closed on Friday, November 10.\nWhat does that mean for banks? Will they be closed both Friday and Saturday? Here\u2019s the latest scoop on Veterans Day banking hours. Keep in mind, if your bank is closed, most major banks have mobile apps that allow you to check your balance, pay bills, and transfer funds. And if you need cash, make sure you use an ATM that is associated with your bank so you don\u2019t have to pay a hefty fee to withdraw some holiday weekend cash.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank will be closed on Veterans Day, but some banks have opted to stay open on Friday and/or Saturday. While some financial institutions may open for limited holiday hours, others, including TD Bank, will be open regular business hours on Friday and Saturday.\nAccording to the Holiday Schedule, in addition to TD Bank, many other major banks will also stay open during regular business hours on Friday, including Bank of America, Citibank, Chase, Capital One, Citizens, HBSC, PNC, Santander, SunTrust, US Bank, and Wells Fargo.\nOn Saturday, it\u2019s going to be hit or miss with bank hours.

However, the U.S. Postal Service will be open on Friday and closed on Saturday.\nAlthough banks and government offices will be closed on either Friday or Saturday, rest assured that retail stores and restaurants will be open throughout the three-day weekend. According to a previous report by the Inquisitr, numerous restaurants will be offering free meals for veterans and active duty military this weekend to honor the brave men and women who have served, or are currently serving, in the U.S. Armed Forces.", "orig_sample_length": 604, "prompt_length": 404, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "s best to check with your local branch for hours of operation.\nAccording to the Holiday Schedule, at least eight banks, including Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, HBSC, Chase, Citizens, Wells Fargo, and TD Bank will be open on Saturday.

{"idx": 311, "truncated_input": "The write-up \u201cDoctor had thyself\u201d (Spectrum, October 4) took up the issue of professional ethics among doctors. Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\nAll human concerns and considerations are at stake so much so that each patient is considered a milch-cow. But all this is antithetical to the concept of a welfare state. Healthcare matters more than anything else in India.\nThe government, intelligentsia, law enforcing agencies and charitable organisations must rise to the occasion and curb illegal and undesirable medical practices. The marketing of drugs should be strictly regulated and supervised. Justice should be prompt and deterrent.\nThe role of a doctor in society ought to be consoling, sustaining and elevating in order to revive the erstwhile cordial and courteous bonds in doctor patient relationship. Still a roaring practice laced with milk of human kindness, credibility and self-esteem will bring fame, prestige and money. Introspect deeply and act resolutely.\nVaranasi or Banaras (Spectrum, October 11) was one of the six flourishing places in the days of the Buddha. British resident, Jonathan Duncan established a Sanskrit college there in 1792. Mrs Annie Besant, an activist of the Theosophical Society started Central Hindu School in 1889, which eventually developed into the Banaras Hindu University in 1915.\nWhen the celebrated Vishvanath Temple in the city was demolished and a mosque was built there under the orders of Aurangzeb, poet Chandar Bhan satirically said: \u201cBa-been karaamat-e-butkhaana-e-mara ai Shaikh/Agar kharaab shavad khaana-e-khuda gardad\u201d (See the miracle of my temple. Even after its destruction it remains the abode of God).\nPeerless poet, Mirza Ghalib, visited Varanasi on December 1, 1827. He was so much enamoured with the place that he stayed there for about a month. In his poem Chiraag-e-dair (lamp of temple) he admired the city. It comprises 108 couplets, a lucky number for the Hindus. Their rosaries have 108 beads. The poet, who described Banaras as the Ka\u2019aba of Hindustan, says, a wise man told him that doomsday would not come, as God did not want the destruction of this elegant city.\nThe practice of giving English titles to Hindi movies (\u201cDesi movies English titles\u201d, Spectrum, Sept 27) is not new, as many movies have had English titles throughout the history of Indian cinema. First and foremost comes to mind films like Street Singer and President which had K.L. Saigal as hero. Mother India (1957) made by Mehboob is considered a landmark in Indian cinema.\nGuru Dutt and Madhubala came up with an evergreen musical comedy Mr & Mrs. 55. Raj Kapoor produced \u201cBoot Polish\u201d (1956) bringing out the struggles of street children. Another one was Love in Shimla (1959) which introduced Sadhana as a new face. Evergreen hero Dev Anand starred in many movies with English titles like Taxi Driver, House No. 44, Paying Guest, CID, Love Marriage, Gambler, Jewel Thief and above all his magnum opus Guide (1966).\nIn \u201cRoad to happiness\u201d (Saturday Extra, Sept. 12) the writer has beautifully enumerated eight points to achieve happiness, which has become a rare commodity in this materialistic and selfish world.\nI fully endorse his points. Nathaniel Cotton\u2019s verse, which the writer quoted to buttress his points, was full of wisdom, prudence, reason, sanity and practical knowledge.\nIt is said that sympathy is a heavenly quality and should be shown to everyone in trouble to attain happiness. Kindness, goodness and loving care of one\u2019s aged and ailing parents, contentment and peace of mind, the belief in \u201clive and let live\u201d, \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d and practice of ahimsa (non-violence) are the key ingredients of happiness. Noble deeds, good food, good thoughts, good conduct devoid of envy, jealousy, rivalry, grudge, malice, back biting and ill-will lead to happiness. The recital of god\u2019s name acts as an icing on the cake.\n", "baseline_completion": "Life is a precious gift of God. It is worth living with all its frustrations, impediments and failures. Those who live it as it comes along can solve problems; overcome hardships to achieve their goals and happiness. One should work and not remain idle to be happy. Bad habits like drinking in excess, smoking, taking opium and other such vices should be shunned as these ruin one\u2019s happiness, home and hearth. Punctuality, the mark of civilisation and culture, must be cultivated to gain happiness.\nThinking about common good rather than about one\u2019s own self, caring more for one\u2019s duties than for rights and providing food, water and shelter to the have-nots can increase one\u2019s happiness manifold.

The present law of reservation for Dalits/Backward Classes is ten years only and the Supreme Court has given a judgement on this point.\nIn fact, at present, there is no reservation for

{"idx": 315, "truncated_input": "Robin Gibb, one of the three singing brothers of the Bee Gees, the long-running Anglo-Australian pop group whose chirping falsettos and hook-laden disco hits like \u201cJive Talkin\u2019 \u201d and \u201cYou Should Be Dancing\u201d shot them to worldwide fame in the 1970s, died on Sunday in London. He was 62 and lived in Thame, Oxfordshire, England.\nThe cause was complications of cancer and intestinal surgery, his family said in a statement.\nMr. Gibb had been hospitalized for intestinal problems several times in the last two years. Cancer had spread from his colon to his liver, and in the weeks before his death he had pneumonia and for a while was in a coma.\nMr. Gibb was the second Bee Gee and third Gibb brother to die. His fraternal twin and fellow Bee Gee, Maurice Gibb, died of complications of a twisted intestine in 2003 at 53. The youngest brother, Andy, who had a successful solo career, was 30 when he died of heart failure, in 1988.\nWith brilliant smiles, polished funk and adenoidal close harmonies, the Bee Gees \u2014 Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb \u2014 were disco\u2019s ambassadors to Middle America in the 1970s, embodying the peacocked look of the time in their open-chested leisure suits and gold medallions.\nThey sold well over 100 million albums and had six consecutive No. 1 singles from 1977 to 1979. They were also inextricably tied to the disco era\u2019s defining movie, \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d a showcase for their music that included the hit \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d its propulsive beat in step with the strut of the film\u2019s star, John Travolta.\nBarry, the oldest brother, was the dominant Bee Gee for most of the group\u2019s existence. But the lead singer for many of the early hits was Robin, whose breaking voice, gaunt frame and gloomy eyes were well suited to convey adolescent fragility. \u201cI Started a Joke\u201d (with the second line, \u201cWhich started the whole world crying\u201d), \u201cI\u2019ve Gotta Get a Message to You,\u201d \u201cMassachusetts\u201d and other heavy-hearted songs brought the Bee Gees to the top of the charts as one of the British Invasion\u2019s most musically conservative groups.\nRobin Hugh Gibb and his twin, Maurice, were born on Dec. 22, 1949, on the Isle of Man, a British dependency in the Irish Sea. (Barry was born there in 1946.) The boys largely grew up in Manchester, England, where the family lived on the edge of poverty. Their father, Hugh, a drummer and bandleader, encouraged his sons to sing. Their mother, Barbara, was also a singer.\nAccording to Bee Gees lore, the boys\u2019 first performance was sometime in the mid-1950s, and unplanned. They had been scheduled to perform as a lip-synching act at a movie theater in Manchester when the record broke, forcing them to sing for real.\nThe family moved to Australia in 1958, and before long the brothers, performing as the Bee Gees \u2014 for Brothers Gibb \u2014 began scoring local hits and appearing on television. They left for London in early 1967 and within weeks had signed with Robert Stigwood, the impresario who guided them in their peak years.\nThe band\u2019s first single in Britain, \u201cNew York Mining Disaster 1941,\u201d was released in April 1967 and reached the Top 20.\nBut in private Robin was far from dull. He and his wife, Dwina Murphy, who survives him, lived in a 12th-century former monastery in Oxfordshire that he had restored and filled with statues of Buddha and suits of armor. In Miami, his mansion was open to celebrities and politicians like Tony Blair.\nRobin briefly left the group in 1969 and tried out a solo career. After he rejoined his brothers, they scored their first No. 1 in the United States with \u201cHow Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u201d in 1971. But with harder rock taking over, the Bee Gees\u2019 popularity ebbed, reaching bottom in 1974 with a series of supper-club gigs in England to pay off tax debts.\nAt that point their label, Atlantic, sent the brothers to Miami for musical experimentation. There, with the 1975 album \u201cMain Course,\u201d they reinvented the Bee Gees\u2019 sound with Latin and funk rhythms, electronic keyboards and vocals that owed a debt to Philadelphia soul. It brought the band its first hits in years: \u201cNights on Broadway\u201d and \u201cJive Talkin\u2019,\u201d which went to No. 1.\nFor many listeners, the Gibbs were the face of disco. Even \u201cSesame Street\u201d got caught up in the trend, with Robin singing on the disco-themed album \u201cSesame Street Fever.\u201d It went gold.\nThe Bee Gees\u2019 1979 album, \u201cSpirits Having Flown,\u201d produced three more No. 1 singles, \u201cToo Much Heaven,\u201d \u201cTragedy\u201d and \u201cLove You Inside Out.\u201d Then, in 1980, the band filed a $200 million lawsuit against Mr. Stigwood, saying he had swindled them out of royalties. Mr. Stigwood countersued for defamation and breach of contract. They settled out of court and publicly reconciled.\nIn the \u201980s the band\u2019s popularity waned in the United States but remained strong abroad. Robin released three solo albums, with limited success. The Bee Gees returned with some moderate hits in the late 1990s and were inducted into the Rock and Roll", "baseline_completion": "Hall of Fame in 1997.

An earlier marriage, to Molly Hullis, ended in divorce.\nMr. Gibb had recently been working on a classical piece, \u201cThe Titanic Requiem,\u201d with Robin-John. It had its premiere in London on April 10, played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but Robin was too ill to attend.\nDespite the Bee Gees\u2019 close association with disco, the Gibb brothers had long insisted that they had no stake in the genre.

{"idx": 317, "truncated_input": "The Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York are several hours northwest of New York City, west of the Hudson River and roughly cover four counties. Considered the frontier in Colonial days, the area was dubbed the \"Borscht Belt\" or \"Jewish Alps\" in the mid-20th century for the hotels, resorts, camps and cottage colonies favored by New York City Jews escaping from the city's heat in the summer. With mountains, cool lakes, numerous streams and rivers and small towns scattered among the forests and farmlands, the area is rich in natural beauty, culture and history. The Catskills have lodging options ranging from country inns to chain hotels, cabins and campgrounds.\nApril 1 is the opening of fishing season in many areas of the Catskills, and Roscoe, in Sulllivan County, is billed the \"Fly Fishing Capital of the World.\" The Upper Beaverkill River meets the Willowemoc River in Roscoe, and the stretch of river between Roscoe and nearby Livingston Manor is open to the public. Just off Route 17 between the two towns, visit the Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum for exhibits and programs related to the sport.\nOn Memorial Day weekend, head to the Woodstock-New Paltz Arts and Crafts Fair at the Ulster County Fairgrounds for arts, crafts, music, food and wine. Running for more than 30 years, the fair has been voted one of America's best by \"Sunshine Artist\" magazine. Late May is also the time to head to Tannersville in Greene County for the Rubber Duck and Crazy Boat Races and Festival. Watch as hundreds of rubber ducks are released or build your own boat for the boat race; the festival also has crafts, music and food.\nVisit Bethel in Sullivan County in the summer to enjoy classical, jazz, rock and country music concerts at Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. Built on the site of the 1969 Woodstock Concert, Bethel Woods offers acres of landscaped grounds, with a monument listing the performers at Woodstock at one corner of the property. The museum focuses not only on the history of the famous concert but also on significant events of the 1960s, including the Civil Rights Movement and the Space Race. Just down the road in Monticello, the Monticello Raceway and Casino, or \"racino,\" offers both thoroughbred harness racing and a casino where you can try your luck at the slot machines or table games.\nHead to Greene County's Windham Mountain for the Fourth of July celebration, where you'll find a parade, a barbecue, music and a fireworks display. The mountain resort offers hiking, biking and horseback riding.\nFall, particularly early to mid-October, is the time for leisurely drives to take in the glory of the autumnal display of color anywhere in the heavily treed Catskills. Book a weekend at a resort such as the Villa Roma Resort and Conference Center in Callicoon, which offers golf, tennis, pools and an arcade room, or explore the Legend of Sleepy Hollow at the Washington Irving Inn in Hunter, a bed and breakfast with themed rooms and cottages. Hunter Mountain hosts an annual Oktoberfest on two weekends in October with music, crafts and food.\nHunting is a popular fall activity in the Catskills. Check the Department of Environmental Conservation website (dec.ny.gov) for dates and license requirements for bow and firearm hunting of deer, turkey, bear, bobcat, waterfowl and small game. You'll need permission to hunt on private property, but some public lands are open to hunting as well. Check with the local Department of Environmental Conservation or a New York Forest Ranger for maps and required permissions for public areas.\nThe long, snowy winters in the Catskills make it a destination for winter sports.

A mob reportedly beat up a local environmentalist who called for government officials to swim in a heavily polluted river in China.\nWe\u2019d written about the river\u2019s plight a week ago (check out the photo of the river to the right).\nInterestingly, the man who was assaulted was not the local business person who offered big money ($32,000) to a government environmental official if he\u2019d swim in the polluted river, but instead they targeted a 60 year old activist who had backed the call.\nWe\u2019re not immune \u201cto two weights, two measures\u201d in the US either (e.g., Wall Street getting away with economic destruction, while the little guy pays the price) but for the most part, it doesn\u2019t involve street violence.\nIt looks like someone is not interested in cleaning up the river.\n\u201cThe whole thing lasted four or five hours until the police arrived. My father got hit in the head by six or seven people, with their fists. He is now feeling dizzy and sleeping all the time,\u201d she added, claiming the attack had been orchestrated by local officials.\nCalls to the mobile phone of the local Communist Party chief went unanswered on Wednesday.\nWe\u2019re heading that way fast\u2026 only with more guns.\nI foresee life as a meme for the bizarre \u201c[You] used the internet, you always use the internet!\u201d said by the mob.\nChina\u2019s path to prosperity and national independence has been betrayed at every juncture by the CCP, a rancid collection of Stalinist\u2019s and Maoist\u2019s with a choke hold on government. They\u2019re not plutocrats like Democrats and Republicans here but they might as well be.\nIt\u2019s almost inevitable at this point that they\u2019ll follow the Russian Stalinisit\u2019s and try to liquidate the extremely deformed Chinese workers state and reintroduce capitalist norms. .\nChina: everything old is new again.

(Heck, right anybody who gets national attention in advocating for any gun control laws gets death threats now.)

Isaf supplies no consistent data on the policy, other than issuing a string of press releases claiming success after success, releases which often describe several raids in different places simultaneously. Researchers Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn wanted to find out exactly how the missions worked.\nYou can read their full report here. Frustrated by the lack of hard data, Strick van Linschoten scraped the reports, then used the Tinderbox database package to process each incident and extract the key numbers.\nWhat he found is a very different picture to that described by Isaf press releases. \"There are still relatively large numbers of Afghans subject to the capture-or-kill raids,\" he says.\nAlthough, interestingly, there has been a decline in", "baseline_completion": "these raids since Petraeus left Afghanistan in July this year.\nThe report is a fund of data crucial to understanding the way Nato has fought the conflict. We've mapped some of the key facts by province, too.\nThis data, painstakingly collated, is the first time we can get a real picture of what is happening.\nAside from occasional scraps thrown to the media by ISAF, this is the first time that we have been able to get a somewhat more nuanced picture of how ISAF is operating, minimum figures for how many people are being detained and killed as well as a makeshift way to evaluate the usefulness of ISAF's own aggregate numbers that supposedly show the successes of the raids in Afghanistan.\nStrick van Linschoten has visualised the timeline of releases below - you can explore it by clicking and dragging - or seeing it on the original site.", "orig_sample_length": 443, "prompt_length": 243, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the number of raids being carried out.

It has not produced a significant number of senior Taliban commanders and has not degraded their ability to wage war against ISAF and the Afghan government,\" Strick van Linschoten concludes.\nStrick van Linschoten and Kuehn are writing a book, An Enemy We Created, which is due to be published by Granta Books in 2014.", "w_wm_output": "the number of raids being conducted.\nThere is, however, little evidence that the raids are actually affecting the Taliban.\nThis is the key graph Strick van Linschoten uses to illustrate his findings.\nWhile it is clear that at the height of the strategy there was a significant impact on the Taliban's overall strength, it is also clear that since the change in strategy (which began with the \"surge\") there has been little overall impact.\nThis is, of course, a limited set of data and will not shed much light on the Taliban's strength, which is almost certainly more than these numbers suggest.\nThe problem of course with isaf is the Talibs style of fighting. When you are fighting a real war you fight to kill the enemy.

Karen Bass (D-Calif.). All that was needed was for Congress to vote on the budget deal to avert another government shutdown and send the legislation to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. And Bass was clear-eyed about what Trump\u2019s theater was masking.\nBass\u2019s first visit to the podcast came just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017. A time when the Los Angeles Democrat said her town halls had turned her into a \u201cpolitical", "baseline_completion": "therapist.\u201d That all changed, Bass said, when she put anxiety into action.\nSo I asked Bass, who was part of a small CBC delegation that met with the president in March 2017, how successful the caucus could be in thwarting him and achieving its goals with Trump in the White House. \u201cWith 55 people and the amount of power that we have on a committee and subcommittee level, it\u2019s all very doable,\u201d she said.

{"idx": 326, "truncated_input": "PARIS \u2013 French children go to school four days a week. They have about two hours each day for lunch. And they have more vacation than their counterparts almost anywhere in the West.\nIt may sound a bit like the famously leisurely work pace enjoyed by their parents, most of whom work 35 hours per week as dictated by law.\nBut the nation&apos;s new government says elementary school kids risk classroom burnout, and is moving to help them cope. The issue: French school days may be relatively few, but they are at least as long as a day of work for adults. Even 6-year-olds are in class until late into the afternoon, when skies are dark, attention flags and stomachs rumble.\nAs a candidate, President Francois Hollande promised to change things by adding a fifth day of classes on Wednesday while shortening the school day. For France, it&apos;s something of a revolutionary idea that would overturn more than a century of school tradition. The thinking is that the days are too full for young children under the current system and that Wednesday free time could be put to more productive use.\n\"France has the shortest school year and the longest day,\" Hollande said at the time, promising change.\nHis education minister, Vincent Peillon, will decide this month how to carry out the reform. He has said he may also compensate for a shorter school day by trimming France&apos;s sacred summer vacation. A panel of experts will present their conclusions on Friday, and the president is expected to address the issue on Tuesday.\nNo proposal affects tradition \u2014 and potentially family and municipal budgets \u2014 as much as what the French call changes to the \"scholastic rhythms.\"\nThere&apos;s been a midweek break in French primary schools dating back to the 19th century, a government concession to the Roman Catholic Church, which wanted children to study the catechism on their weekday off. In today&apos;s secular France, Wednesdays currently are a blur of sports, music, tutoring for families of means, or a scramble for working parents struggling to get by \u2014 who must either find a sitter or send their kids to a full day at a state-run \"leisure center.\"\nThings aren&apos;t exactly easy for French kids.\nDespite long summer breaks and the four-day school week, French elementary school students actually spend more hours per year in school than average \u2014 847, compared with 774 among countries in OECD, a club of wealthy nations. But the time is compressed into fewer days each year. The French school day begins around 8:30 and ends at 4:30 p.m., even for the youngest, despite studies showing the ability of young children to learn deteriorates as the day goes on.\nBut many parents are afraid that the changes will force them to figure out extra childcare five days a week, especially at schools where the afterschool program amounts to sitting silently at a desk for two hours or near-chaos in the play areas. Under the education proposal, school would end at lunchtime on Wednesday.\n\"It&apos;s completely unrealistic,\" Valerie Marty, president of the national parents&apos; organization, said of the proposed timetable. \"They have to figure out who will take care of the children after school, who will finance it.\"\nIn France, the answer is usually the government.\nThe state is expected to provide for just about everything education-related: Classes come under the national budget, and lunches and leisure are the domain of municipalities. So if school lets out most days at 3:30 p.m., under the plan most recently floated, more working parents than ever would need afterschool care \u2014 and towns would have to figure out what to do with restless children. That would almost certainly involve something more constructive than sitting quietly at desks, kicking around a ball, or playing cards until the evening when parents get out of work.\nThe Education Ministry has proposed more organized extracurricular activities like sports, theater and art to replace the relatively free form time children now have after school. But that means trained staff and, of course, more money from local budgets already strained in difficult economic times.\nMarty, who has three children, proposes something entirely different: lengthening lunch to three hours.\n\"After a meal, children have a moment when they&apos;re tired. They&apos;re not ready for intellectual activities and could do something more relaxing,\" she said, suggesting theater, or quiet time in a library for others. Afterward, she said, classes could resume until evening.\nTrimming the hallowed summer break is another tricky proposition. The school year ends at the beginning of July. Some families take July off, some August. But nearly everyone takes a month, and many French families travel for the entire period.\nPeillon said he was flexible about vacation time: \"If the question of vacation is blocking things, I&apos;ll propose that the prime minister leave it alone.\"\nEric Charbonnier, an OECD education expert supports the proposed changes. He believes the current system isn&apos;t", "baseline_completion": "working for the children most in need of a good education.\n\"A schedule with long days and lots of vacation is not one that will help the students who are having problems,\" he said.\nPeter Gumbel, a British journalist who has lived in France since 2002 and written a book about the country&apos;s education system, said the length of the school day is only part of the problem. He says that French schooling is outmoded, dull and grinding. His take is clear from his book&apos;s title: \"They Shoot Schoolchildren, Don&apos;t They?\"\n\"You have to tackle head-on the fundamental questions of the classroom,\" he said, citing \"the sheer heaviness of the national curriculum, the enormous amount of hours, the enormous amount of unbroken attention required, and the sheer boredom and tiredness.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1383, "prompt_length": 1183, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "good for either kids or teachers, who are exhausted after a long day.\n\"Children have the capacity to learn, but it&apos;s difficult to achieve when they are tired and bored,\" he said. \"Teachers are human beings, too. They also have an intellectual capacity. They can&apos;t be expected to teach as well if they are feeling stress.\"\nBut Charbonnier said he has heard the complaints about the extra cost for municipalities that would be needed to run after-school activities and warned that governments must be careful to avoid a \"creeping redistribution of wealth.\"\n\"We can&apos;t spend money on children without considering how to help parents,\" he said.\nFrance is hardly alone in considering changes to the school week, with countries from Germany to the United States looking at different ways to adjust for growing numbers of working mothers and fathers.\nThe German", "w_wm_output": "holding kids back.\n\"But to be very critical, it is at the cost of very large stress for children, families and teachers,\" Charbonnier said.\nParents speak of tense, quiet conversations at dinner parties and the stress of packing lunches and racing out the door for school.\n\"It&apos;s a real ordeal, it&apos;s a real drama for all French families. And it is really a drama for children, to have so much stress,\" said Barbara Perpillant, a mother of two.\nChanging school rhythms will allow French children to avoid the \"burnout\" they experience now, she said.\n\"There is really a real risk that kids could become depressed with so much stress.\"\nFollow Sylvie Corbet at www.twitter.com/AP_Sylvie", "no_wm_output_length": 200,

{"idx": 327, "truncated_input": "A lot has changed since the Federal Reserve decided in September once again to take a pass at raising interest rates and normalizing monetary policy. For hawks, not much of it has been particularly good.\nWhen choosing not to move last month, the Federal Open Market Committee referred to some vague \"international developments\" it was monitoring to decide when it would enact its first rate hike since 2006.\nFor Wall Street, the message was clear: Fed officials worried that the slowdown in China would spread to other areas of the global economy, dampening prospects at home and making it the wrong time to lift off from the zero-bound range where it has been for seven years.\nSince then, the news from China has gotten marginally better, with the government reporting that gross domestic product gained 6.9 percent in the most recent period.\nThe news from home, though, has improved little. Expectations for U.S. third-quarter GDP have tumbled in recent weeks, with the consensus now at just a 1.7 percent gain, according to FactSet, down from 3.9 percent in the inventory-inflated second quarter and well off hopes for 2.5 percent or better. CNBC's Rapid Update tracker has the estimate down to 1.4 percent.\nA batch of economic data points Tuesday helped drive home the weakness: Consumer confidence declined and was below economist expectations, orders for long-lasting goods fell in line with consensus at 1.2 percent, and the Markit Purchasing Managers Index survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level since January, with the hiring component particularly worrisome.\nIndeed, the jobs market, considered perhaps the brightest spot in the economy, has tailed off considerably, with September adding just 142,000 positions, according to the latest government report that came out after the last Fed meeting.\nNot to mention corporate profits, which currently are tracking for a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\"Global weakness, a large inventory overhang, economic uncertainty \u2014 take your pick. The current environment leaves businesses hesitant to invest in everything from equipment to structures to additional employees,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, said in summing up the most recent indicators.\nThe conditions add up to a headache for the Fed during a year in which Chair Janet Yellen and her top lieutenants repeatedly have expressed a desire to begin the rate normalization process. The first hike was supposed to happen in March, which would have been five months after the Fed ended its quantitative easing program, a series of monthly bond purchases that exploded the central bank's balance sheet past $4.5 trillion.\nNow, the target again appears to be March, but in 2016. Traders at the CME assign just a 1 in 20 chance that the FOMC will announce a hike on Wednesday. The outlook has dimmed so much that traders say there's a 16 percent probability the Fed will still hold steady next September.\nFed watchers should expect the FOMC to tone down its assessment of the economy in the statement it releases at the meeting's conclusion, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\"The financial markets will treat the marking down of the Fed's near-term assessment of the economy as dovish, thereby further reducing the probability of a December 2015 rate hike, because the data will simply not be strong enough to convince the financial markets the Fed can actually begin tightening,\" LaVorgna said in a note.\n\"And if the Fed determines that it really wants to raise rates this year, the likely tightening in financial conditions that would accompany such a desire would give policymakers pause,\" he added. \"Therefore, we do not expect a rate hike until the March 2016 meeting at the earliest.\"\nSure, there's been a rebound of sort in the global equity markets, but even that only seems to exemplify how much investors have come to depend on monetary largess from the Fed and its global counterparts. The S&P 500 index had been in a sharp tumble around the time of the September meeting, falling more than 12 percent from its July peak until it cratered 12 days after the FOMC decision.\nSince then, the market is up nearly 10 percent, buoyed in part by hopes of a lower-for-longer Fed.\nSumming up the Faustian bargain between the two entities, Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America Merr", "baseline_completion": "ill Lynch, wrote, \"Global weakness is OK for U.S. markets as long as the Fed refrains from hiking rates, and vice versa it would be OK from a markets perspective for the Fed to begin hiking rates if global weakness diminishes (but not OK if US data rebounds in isolation).\"\nMikkelsen added that it's important the Fed acknowledge that the U.S. growth story is deteriorating.\n\"Hence risk assets have rallied for three weeks prompted by the turn to weaker U.S. data that began with the weak September jobs report, as the Fed's rate decision is understood to be completely data dependent,\" he said. \"However, clearly for the market rally to be sustained it would be helpful if (the) FOMC statement tilted dovish by acknowledging this turn to weaker U.S. data.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1267, "prompt_length": 1067, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ill Lynch, wrote in a note that \"the Fed has successfully convinced markets that a

believe the Fed's hand is not as strong as it might seem, and investors will likely start to challenge the Fed's dovish bias in the coming weeks and months,\" he added.\nThe Fed's dilemma\nThere is a big question mark on the outlook for the U.S. economy, but the Fed has little room to maneuver if it wants to maintain its commitment to keep the funds rate near zero for at least several more years.\nThat's because the central bank has already said it can't move until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent, and", "w_wm_output": "ill Lynch, said: \"The current phase of lower

Registration starts at 8 a.m. Chalkers will begin their work at 9 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m.\n\"Chalk art is a wonderful and unique form of creativity,\" said Gus Sako, the event's organizer and owner of the Octopus' Garden novelty store in the Uptown.\n\"Give the smallest toddler a piece of chalk and sidewalk and they will be happy for hours,\" he said.\n\"I get off work and usually just head to the sidewalk,\" she said with a chuckle. \"It's just too irresistible not to take part.\"\nBoth women also say creating chalk art can wreak havoc on the body, especially the knees, the back and shoulders.\n\"It's pretty hard for anyone to whip out a drawing in the hot sun on a dirty sidewalk. And, at almost 66, my knees are pretty creaky,\" Loomis said. \"On the other hand, my kids just gave me a gardening stool with rails that might be just the thing!\"\nCalicoat says creating chalk art is like doing one-arm push ups for hours.\n\"I", "baseline_completion": "'ve been trying to train myself to use my left hand to paint so I'll probably do the same thing with chalk,\" Calicoat said.\nThe Chalk Art Festival was started by the now defunct Corporate Council for the Arts as a regional arts activity, Sako said. The festival moved to several locations until it finally settled at the Uptown a few years ago.\nCategories and registration fees are: Up to age 5 $5; Ages 6-9 $5; Ages 10-12 $7; Ages 13-17 $7; Ages 18 and older $12. Sidewalks to be used for the chalk artistry will be on George Washington Way, Jadwin Avenue, Symons Streets and Williams Boulevard.\nFor more information, call 946-0077 or 943-6542.", "orig_sample_length": 553, "prompt_length": 353, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "don't know how these artists are able to do it,\" she said.\nThere are no rules to the festival, although the organizers would like to see it stay clean and family friendly.\n\"We're not going to have anyone enforcing rules or making people clean up,\" Sako said. \"But we would like to have everyone, or at least the majority of everyone, be respectful of the courtesy of chalk art.\"\nThe weather also is out of the organizers hands.\n\"We've been very fortunate the last few years to have good weather,\" she said. \"It's hard to say what will happen, though. Last year, we had a beautiful day. And, the year before, it was cloudy and rained a lot. It really all depends on the day.\"\nThe event is free and open to the public. There is a $500 cash prize for the best work.\n", "w_wm_output": "get to wear my favorite pair of cool sandals, carry chalk around with me all day, have my hair in pigtails, eat whatever I want \u2013 and I'm not even sweating,\" she said.\n\"Whether you are a little kid who's drawing a picture, or an art professional who's drawing a picture, it's still art,\" Calicoat said.\nMore than 100 chalk artists, including artists from the U.S. and Canada, will compete for prizes at the event.\nTrophies will be awarded to the best overall design, best overall artist, best artist in each age category and best team effort.\nParticipating chalk artists must be 18 or older and will compete in two categories: individual and team.\nParticipation is free, but a minimum $1 donation is required to enter.\nGiven a choice between drawing a cartoon character and", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies": [0.8931289911270142, 0.9186203479766846, 0.9097079038619995,

{"idx": 334, "truncated_input": "Don Keough thinks Ireland should have a Diaspora Minister, saying it would transform Diaspora/Irish relations.\nHe also wants to see Notre Dame back in Dublin playing football in the next couple of years. Tourism leaders will surely salivate after 30,000 US fans showed up the last time they played.\nHe has just helped raise $3 million for a world class 1916 Rising documentary prepared at Notre Dame and already bought by RTE Public Television in the US and the BBC.\nHe also believes that Ireland faced the worst crisis any western government had after the economic collapse and that American business leaders are keenly aware of how well they have handled it.\nHe is the man who brought Notre Dame and Coca-Cola to Ireland. He also brought Bill Gates and Warren Buffett his lifelong friend too, hosting them at the K Club on their first ever visit. He serves on Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board with Buffett and is still an advisor to the board of Coca-Cola, the company he served for 40 years.\nAs president of Coca-Cola he blazed the multinational trail to Ireland in the 1970s. As Chairman of the Board at Notre Dame he created the Keough-Naughton Irish Institute in 1994 and their Dublin campus and laid the groundwork for the university to play in Dublin in September 2012.\nAt 86 he is far from a back number. He is Chairman of the Board of Allen and Company, the New York investment bank, and co-hosts their annual Sun Valley retreat attended by world business leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch.\nHe divides his time still between New York and Atlanta, his home, and keeps a schedule a younger man would surely tire of. Every year he visits his beloved Ireland with his family and recently paid a visit to New Ross in Wexford and the famine-era replica ship like the one his great-grandfather Michael embarked on back in the 1840s.\nHe has come a long way from Michael\u2019s lonely journey. Warren Buffet once stated that two men he met in business, Jack Welch and Don Keough, could have become president of the United States if they had chosen a political rather than a business career.\nKeough demurs, but there is little doubt that he has been Ireland\u2019s greatest advocate in America for decades now. His sense of the potential of the Diaspora was uppermost in his mind during our New York interview.\nHow would you approach the Diaspora if you were the Irish government?\nIf a person wants to be part of that Diaspora the Irish government needs to acknowledge that. A good start would be a Minister for the Diaspora, who would be charged with creating that welcome and outreach.\nI know when you become an Irish citizen in Ireland there is an event around it. If you announce you are of the Diaspora and coming to Ireland that is important too.\nIsrael has a minister of the Diaspora, I read in the New York Times, where and I quote, \u201cOver the next five years the Israeli government will spend $1.4 billion on a range of initiatives to strengthen Jewish identity abroad and Jewish connections to Israel and vice versa.\u201d That is the kind of thinking we need.\nThere should be someone as Minister who is a constant part of the Diaspora, who is reporting back to cabinet.\nIt is an asset that needs to be used. Just to announce that minister would be huge all over the world.\nI was delighted to see Irish President Higgins mention and dedicate his trip to the Irish Diaspora in Britain in his remarks during the state visit.\nWe are everywhere across this world, this Irish army waiting to help this small country their people left from.\nThink of it \u2013 70 million people worldwide, millions of whom are seeking a relationship with their ancestral home. What an opportunity!\nIf the Notre Dame game can bring 35,000 people to Ireland what could a massive outreach do? The Notre Dame game demonstrated what was possible. It was the ultimate power of the Diaspora that they didn\u2019t just come to the game \u2013 they captured the country.\nI was at church last week in Atlanta. A couple who came to the game came up and told me they were returning again, they fell utterly in love with Ireland. They are just one small example of what I\u2019m saying.\nWhat is the upside potential for the Diaspora do you think?\nI think within a matter of five years you would double the number of people who would visit Ireland. That would be my goal.\nIt needs preparation; Diaspora packages need to be put together. A self-proclaimed member of the Diaspora should feel like Notre Dame fans do, part of something bigger, greater than the sum of its parts. There should be special discounts, meetings, and outreach.\nLook what we did with Notre Dame \u2013 35,000 came and there was a massive range of activities.\nThe visit to Ireland is always enjoyable, despite the weather sometimes. Ireland and what it continues to represent is the best argument for itself.\nWhat brought you there first to your Irish roots?\nWell, I wanted to bring my children to Ireland. My father had gone late in his life and he was deeply moved by it. I\u2019ll never forget how proud he was to go.\nIt was the memory of my father. It was the happiest trip of his life, and he said he was so upset he didn\u2019t go when he was younger so that was always on my mind. So the first time I went was when I could afford it. My father touched Ireland for me.\nI brought my children and we drove everywhere. This was the early 1970s. I was so excited. I wanted to get involved. I remember years later reading your magazine Irish America and saying, finally, someone gets it.\nYou first created the links between the University of Notre Dame and Ireland. There was very little connection until you came along. What made you want to do it?\nWell, Notre Dame had an extraordinary Irish background. Almost all the presidents had Irish connections. It was just waiting to be connected into Ireland.\nWhat made me do the Keough-Naughton Irish Institute was Professor Chris Fox, who I had met, and he told me we had an amazing Irish collection of books and major historical links and he had a deep interest in Ireland. I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something?\u201d Then the issue was how do we get it started.\nSo I talked to Seamus and said, \u201cYou have some amazing ideas about what an Irish studies program should be like we\u2019ll give you the blank canvas and the paints and you paint the Irish studies program you want at the home of the Irish in America.\u201d By golly, that was what exactly he did.\nOne of the most exciting things in my life has been to see it develop the way it has. It was perfect timing and Chris was a great leader, and the university supported it totally.\nSome 10,000 students have studied there in the past 20 years and thousands go to Ireland. Then Martin Naughton came on board as my partner. He has been amazing.\nMartin and his family played a massive role in the success of Notre Dame game. It became a happening because of Martin and it was great that the Taoiseach was fully involved, and we even got the weather!\nI always remember telling Martin about the idea of the game and really getting the Irish involved. He asked, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d It was a huge boost to the institute and we have enlarged our efforts and numbers in Ireland since.\nYou have a great new Irish project as well.\nYes, the 1916 landmark documentary series. BBC, RTE and PBS will show a three-part landmark documentary about the 1916 Rising and we have raised the money, almost $3 million for it. We are very excited about that. The series will run to coincide with the centenary of the Easter Rising.\nWhat has Ireland meant to you overall?\nIreland has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. To have such an involvement there is a privilege. My family loves it and we have all spent amazing times there. I wanted to buy a house there, but my wife Mickie said I\u2019d never leave it.\nHow is Ireland doing now in your opinion?\nSo the Kenny government had no easy way to solve the problems, and so they had the toughest job of any country in the world.\nThey have done well. You hear a lot of respect for Ireland now over here. They faced the toughest problems and were the first to demonstrate that they were working their way out of it.\nI look on what happened with a lot of pride on how they have done it. It has been very tough on the Irish people I know, but you have to give them credit. I\u2019m very optimistic about what is going to happen. A lot of smart Americans are getting involved there now, guys like John Malone.\nWill you bring Notre Dame football back to Ireland?\nIt is not up to me but my own view is they will be back. The call to Ireland for Notre Dame is very strong. Maybe within the next couple of years.\nAre you still bullish on US?\nWhen I talk about the US I say never bet against it, these are the most resilient people in the world.\nWe have an amazing gene pool a collection of people from all over the world who came not to exploit but to find a new way to grow and develop, many of them were running away from poverty and oppression.\nThey could see hope here those that came. It took enormous courage for people to get up and leave in the first place.\nI\u2019m an absolute optimist; my own journey proves it from a small farm in Iowa to the presidency of Coca-Cola.\nWho do you consider inspirational figures?\nFather Ted Hesburgh at Notre Dame. He is an absolute inspiration; still a simple priest. His most important moment in his life is when he says Mass.\nI took him to Latin America once. We called on several heads of state. The minute I brought him in there they paid no attention to me. He spoke to them in Portuguese, Spanish and charmed them all.\nHe was an incredible visionary who served six presidents on issues such as civil rights and immigration and built one of the great universities. There were those who said a Catholic university could never reach the heights of academic excellence, but Father Hesburgh knew differently.\nWarren Buffet still tap dances to work every day. He has arranged to give all his wealth away, but he\u2019d be rich in every important way with or without it.\nHe lives a very simple life. We have been friends for decades. I lived across the street from him in Omaha many years ago and he still lives there, in a modest house, like the man.\nOutside of my own father, of the people I have worked with Warren Buffett stands out. He is a learning machine, a great philanthropist. He has kept an", "baseline_completion": "amazing sense of humility.\nWhat is the best life lesson you have learned?\nThe life lesson I have learned is that wealth has nothing to do with money.

No one wants to be around uninteresting people I tell them. Young people today don\u2019t want to be vulnerable.

The United States hopes that the ceasefire will enable the Taliban to experience the blessings of peace while celebrating the festival with their families.\nMr Pompeo, who will be arriving in Islamabad after the ceasefire, is expected to urge the new Pakistani government to back its efforts for bringing a durable peace in Afgha\u00adnistan.

They are building a replica of the tall peaked roof and inner cupola of an ornate wooden synagogue that stood for 300 years in the town of Gwozdziec, now in Ukraine.\nThe replica, which will be 85 percent of the original size of the building, will be installed as one of the key components of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, currently under construction in Warsaw and scheduled to open in 2013.\nIts elaborate structure and the intricate painted decoration on the cupola ceiling will reproduce a form of architectural and artistic expression that was wiped out in World War II, when the Nazis put the torch to some 200 wooden synagogues in Eastern Europe. Many of them, like that in Gwozdziec, were centuries old and extraordinarily elaborate, with tiered roofs and richly decorative interior painting.\nThe Gwozdziec Synagogue, built in the 17th and 18th centuries, was a \u201ctruly resplendent synagogue that exemplified a high point in Jewish architectural art and religious painting,\u201d the architectural historian Thomas C. Hubka, an expert on the building, has written.\nConstructing the replica is a joint project of the museum in Warsaw and the Handshouse Studio, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that emphasizes learning by building, particularly the reconstruction of historical structures and other objects.\nThe Browns conducted years of research on Eastern Europe\u2019s lost wooden synagogues before embarking on construction of the Gwozdziec replica in Sanok in May. They studied prewar photographs, drawings and other documentation, built models and made on-site investigations of wooden churches and other buildings still found in Poland and Ukraine.\nThere are also several impressive masonry synagogues within an easy drive of Sanok. The 18th-century synagogue in Lancut, now a museum, has beautifully restored interior painting and other decoration. One in Rymanow stood for decades as a ruin but has been partially rebuilt, with a tall peaked roof now protecting the vigorous but sadly fading frescoes of Biblical animals and Jerusalem that grace its walls.\nIn Lesko, the 17th-century synagogue was rebuilt in the 1960s and today houses a gallery of local arts and crafts. Lesko\u2019s vast Jewish cemetery, just a short walk away, is one of the oldest in Poland, with massive tombstones dating to the 16th century.\nFor the Gwozdziec project, an international team of nearly 30 master craftsmen from the Timber Framers Guild are being joined by groups of students from Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where the Browns teach.\nTimber framers came from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Belgium and Japan to lend their skills, all on a volunteer basis.\nAll the work is being carried out using techniques and tools that the builders of the original synagogue would have used: axes, saws, mallets and other hand-held implements. The aim is to gain an understanding of just what went into the building of the synagogue and how its construction would have been envisaged and carried out \u2014 and also to lend authenticity to the replica.\n\u201cIt brings back the lost story of the synagogue, the town, this culture,\u201d said Patrick Goguen, a student at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.\nThe project", "baseline_completion": "is occurring in several stages. Building the timber-framed roof and cupola is the first stage, running through June. Students and artists will hold workshops this summer and next summer to reproduce the intricate polychrome painting that adorned the ceiling of the cupola. These workshops will be held in eight Polish towns in masonry synagogues that still stand.\nThe timber framing is taking place in a corner of Sanok\u2019s Ethnographic Park, a sprawling open-air folk-architecture museum that displays wooden buildings \u2014 houses, barns, churches, chapels and even beehives \u2014 that have been transferred from a number of villages in the region.\nHere, thick logs are being hewn by hand into flat-sided timbers \u2014 a process that can take two days per log \u2014 and then manually sawed into thinner pieces.

These were the early years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, when Poland was enjoying a period of unprecedentedly peaceful coexistence among its diverse populations, including Jews and Catholics.\nWealthy Jews from across the continent were coming to Poland to settle and to take advantage of the commercial and cultural freedom that Poland offered.

{"idx": 339, "truncated_input": "The SNP's internal feud reached new depths of bitterness last night when party leader Alex Salmond was told by treasurer Ian Blackford to apologise for criticisms made last week or face being sued for defamation.\nAs moves continued to oust Mr Blackford, the party was also preparing disciplinary action against one of his closest allies, Ms Margo MacDonald, who faces accusations of breaking internal rules by publicly challenging a parliamentary group decision.\nMs MacDonald, a critic of Mr Salmond's leadership style, will be dealt with on Thursday at a meeting which her supporters claim could mark the start of a campaign to have her deselected.\nNationalist spokesmen desperately sought to play down the effects of the furious row which erupted between Mr Salmond and Mr Blackford last week over reports that the SNP was in deep financial trouble.\nPress officer Kevin Pringle refused to give details of the behind-the-scenes leadership attack on Mr Blackford at the weekend party executive meeting which passed a motion of no confidence in him by 18 votes to three.\nSNP rules allow the executive to admonish, suspend or expel a member - which some observers think could be the leadership's next move if Mr Blackford stays put.\nParty insiders have pointed privately to Mr Blackford as the source of recent stories about the SNP's financial state. Mr Blackford has hotly denied any wrongdoing. The cause of the row is Mr Blackford's reputedly hard line as treasurer in drawing up tough housekeeping rules for the party which is in debt.\nHe is thought privately to believe Mr Salmond and former chief executive Michael Russell, together spent irresponsibly during the Scottish Parliament elections and then left him to clear up the financial mess. Mr Blackford has repeatedly said that as a prominent and wealthy banker in Edinburgh he must ensure his conduct is above reproach because his professional reputation is on the line.\nThe latest dispute between the leader and treasurer involves the extent of the party's overdraft and the effectiveness of Mr Blackford's efforts to have it cleared before the General Election.\nHe and Mr Salmond were involved in an acrimonious dispute last summer after The Herald revealed that Stagecoach millionaire Brian Souter had made a major contribution - said to be about #200,000 - to the SNP but had not been named as the source. Rules at the time did not require the identity of major donors to be revealed but parties had agreed to abide by the spirit of the new procedures.\nMr Blackford irritated Mr Salmond, who claimed the SNP had behaved perfectly properly, with his insistence that there must be no ''jiggery pokery''.\nRelations between the two men have never recovered and hit a new low last week with newspaper claims that the SNP was broke and had been forced to sell its Edinburgh HQ to help pay off an overdraft believed to be #400,000.\nIn fact, the SNP had planned long ago to sell its offices. The party is believed to have struck an agreement on the sale last week and it must now find a new headquarters.\nProceeds from the sale are not expected to be used in clearing the overdraft which deputy party leader John Swinney predicted last month would be paid off around the end of this year and which was about #600,000 at its worst.\nMr Blackford, who is reputedly wealthy, told Radio Clyde that when he was involved in talks with his bank about personally helping the SNP out of its financial difficulty, Mr Salmond was encouraging former party leader Willie Wolfe to run against him as treasurer. Mr Wolfe subsequently withdrew. ''I don't need lessons from Alex Salmond on integrity or trust,'' Mr Blackford said.\nThe SNP would not confirm a report that Mr Salmond accused Mr Blackford of incompetence and of destabilising the party and had appeared to blame him for the overspend.\nHe rejected suggestions that he and allies like Ms MacDonald were being purged as an offensive against dissidents. ''I don't believe in", "baseline_completion": "conspiracy theories,'' he said.\nMr Blackford pointed out that his treasurer's report to the national council last month had been accepted without questioning.\nMs MacDonald incurred the wrath of the leadership when she complained publicly about the parliamentary party's refusal to set aside SNP debating time in the chamber for her ideas for exploring the use of cannabis, particularly as an aid to those suffering pain. She accused some of her colleagues of ''reneging'' on the issue.\nbetween the leader and treasurer.\nLabour revelled in the SNP disarray. Scotland Office Minister Brian Wilson said: ''Alex Salmond's control freak tendencies have finally come home to roost. Having ousted the party treasurer in the night of the long sgian dubhs he has now turned his sights on the independence-minded Margo MacDonald.", "orig_sample_length": 1143, "prompt_length": 943, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "dissidents,'' he told The Herald. ''We're one party. I guess there are those who are more committed than others. There's a diversity of opinion.''\nAsked about the fate of Mr Blackford, Mr Salmond said: ''The party executive is the party executive. We are going to have a debate about the finances of the party.''\nIn a sign of the intense feeling among nationalists about the row, a letter signed by 33 members of the party executive was sent to the party's chief executive, Peter Murrell, in support of Mr Blackford.\nOne of the signatories, Angus Robertson, the party's new chief whip, refused to say whether Mr Salmond had ever apologised for the personal attacks.\nIain MacWhirter: Salmond's troubles are his own fault\nTHERE is no need for the Scottish National Party to tear itself", "w_wm_output": "purges and I don't want anybody else to believe in purges,'' he said.\nMr Blackford said he believed there was an ''unsavoury character in the woodpile'' behind the recent leaks. He rejected suggestions he may be forced to resign.\nHe said it was Mr Salmond who had turned down a meeting in London with the Group of Eight, including Mr Russell, to sort out internal differences.\nHe said it would be for Mr Russell to explain why the decision was made.\nMs MacDonald's supporters say that since her appointment as the nationalists' spokesman for health, she has become increasingly estranged from Mr Salmond and his chief advisers.\nThe Westminster group has met to discuss the disciplinary process against her.\nParty sources said Ms MacDonald's actions

These tragedies are too frequent, and are, as the president said, heartbreaking.\nWe need to talk about gun laws.

There are common-sense laws that can help prevent these tragedies, and Americans support them.\nThe \u201cFix Gun Checks Act,\u201d if passed, would make it tougher for the mentally ill to legally buy guns by strengthening background checks so people like James Holmes (the Aurora shooter) can\u2019t acquire guns. Ninety percent of Americans want to fix gaps in government databases that allow the mentally ill or drug users from buying guns. Even gun owners support the laws.\nEighty-two percent of gun owners (National Rifle Association and non-NRA members) believe that a criminal background check should be required for anyone purchasing a gun, according to data released by Republican pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns earlier this year, 76 percent of gun owners support prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns, 80 percent support mandatory gun safety training for anyone applying for a concealed permit, and 78 percent of gun owners believe that concealed permits should only be granted to applicants who have not committed violent misdemeanors.\nThe NRA, which fights against all this, is out of touch \u2014 even with its own membership. Its power to dictate this debate has to be challenged.\nThe data on assault weapons is just as telling. The man identified Friday as the gunman, Adam Lanza was armed with semiautomatic pistols and a semiautomatic rifle and the killers in Aurora and Portland both used an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle. Sixty-three percent of Americans said they favor a nationwide ban on assault weapons, according to a 2011 CBS/New York Times poll, and 63 percent favored banning high-capacity magazines that hold many rounds of ammunition.\nWe found, in a 2011 survey we conducted for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, that 57 percent of Americans support a law that would limit the size of ammunition clips so that the gun could not fire more than 10 bullets without having to be reloaded. Only a third, or 34 percent, of Americans opposed that law.\nThe Brady Bill, which expired under President George W. Bush, and that Obama said he supported, regulated these kinds of assault weapons (AR-15). Those guns are now unregulated and the result is tragedy after tragedy that won\u2019t end until elected leaders step up.\nSupport for sounder, safer gun laws is not restricted to blue states or big urban cities. In a study conducted by Lake Research Partners earlier this year in swing state-senate districts in Virginia, we found that two-thirds of voters (65 percent) in a rural western Virginia district believe the gun laws should be made stronger \u2014 including 52 percent who strongly believe so. Just 24 percent say they should be less restrictive.\nNinety-two percent of voters in a state senate district centered in Roanoke, Virginia, strongly endorsed requiring background checks for people purchasing guns and permits for people who want to carry a concealed loaded weapon.\nThe NRA and those who oppose gun safety measures should welcome a gun-control debate \u2014 especially if they think they have the winning hand.\nThe consistent lack of leadership on this issue is stunning. But what is most unnerving is that it does not have to be this way \u2013 the American people support common sense gun laws.\nOthers have said, even on Friday, that now is not the time to discuss more gun laws. They said this same thing after Aurora, after Portland, and now after Newtown. They are trying to silence the millions of Americans who want stronger protections from gun violence in their communities.\nThese silencers, led by the NRA, continue to use the 2011 Gallup poll, which we have already explained is problematic, to shut down the debate about new gun laws that will make us safer. That poll said that 43 percent of Americans support stricter gun laws, a 6 percentage point drop from 2008.\nBut as the numbers we have cited here show, this single Gallup question is too shallow to really tell the story of what Americans think about gun safety measures.\nNow is the time to have a discussion about gun laws that will make our communities and families safer. The American people are ready.\nObama showed great courage earlier this year when he stood up for the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry. His courage and leadership is needed here too. These tragedies will happen again and again until our leaders stand up and pass meaningful gun-safety laws that the American public supports.\nNo, the public doesn\u2019t agree.\nThe majority of Americans support the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. This is a fact.\nThe public does not agree. The only reason there were so many deaths is because the federal ban on firearms within 100feet of a school does not permit a responsible citizen from carrying a firearm. Otherwise someone would have dropped this Perp in his tracks. The police and your gov\u2019t can\u2019t be everywhere and make you safe. Grow up and start taking responsibility for your own security. This article represents the psychology of the victim.\nThe Republicans need any and all fringe groups to make up for the fact that they represent a small percentage of the electorate.\nTheir greatest fear is that people will figure them out.\nWhich public is this that you speak of? The 26% as usual? Stop using tragedy to push your BS agendas.\nAlmost every Swiss man has an assault rifle and its ammunition, at home, as part of his obligation to do military service. Yet killings using these rifles are extremely rare. Why?\nThe two writers of this \u201copinion piece\u201d (you noted, I didn\u2019t call it news, nor refer to the authors as journalists), have managed to present about as much political drivel and spin as I\u2019ve ever seen, in one single story. The vast majority of the article is composed of opinion, half truths, and highly targeted, and vague opinion \u201cpolls\u201d. PULEEZE, can we get some real journalism here?\nA species that eats its young or fails to protect them becomes extinct. Think about it.\n@saildog07. You are clearly remarkably ignorant of what the US is, what we face as a people and what \u201cinalienable rights\u201d means.\nI think we should ban meth and heroin, that would keep it off the streets and, keep people from doing it.\nThe Colordao theater killer chose the only movie theater within 20 miles that had a ban on concealed weapons. You want the only people in the world to have guns to be governments and criminals? a naive concept.\nThis guy was insane \u2013 lets address the problems with mental illness and get some security at schools for God\u2019s sake.\nFor the first time in my life, I am thinking about buying a gun.\nThe only places where these mass shootings have happened are where guns are not allowed. (Schools, churches, government buildings) These people maybe mentally ill but they still know enough to do this in places where someone can\u2019t shoot back at them. Anyplace that does not allow legal gun owners to carry a firearm should be required to have an armed guard 24/7. Even then the armed guard won\u2019t be in the right place at the right time. I would feel much safer sending my kids to the school in Texas with the Guardian program where some of the teachers are licensed to carry firearms. Outlaw firearms and only criminals will have them.\nThis is not what the public wants. This is what the liberals want for the public.\nI believe in gun control. I control mine very well. How about controlling the pez dispensing of mind altering, psychosis enducing drugs you\u2019re giving people. Even dispensing these harmful drugs to young adults!\nIn the Supreme Court case, Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748 (2005), the court ruled that our local police are not responsible for protecting us. SOOOOOO, who IS responsible for protecting us? We are responsible. That\u2019s why I responsibly conceal carry. I protect my wife and 2 small children. When more responsible people carry, violent crime goes down. The FBI crime statistics don\u2019t lie. Why do the left and gun grabbing crowd ignore this fact? Liberalism is a mental disorder.\nLets look one poll that this particular article is using for it\u2019s numbers.\nThe poll used 2 Senate Districts in the State of VA. District 21 and District 38.\nwith the total numbers of respondents being 305 voters in District 21 and 302 voters in district 38.\nThat\u2019s a fairly small sample size considering Roanoke VA (part of district 21) has a population of 92,376 (2010 numbers) but polls being what they are they can\u2019t call every registered voter.\nSo they are making a statement for the entire state of Virginia with a population of 8 million give or take from the words of 607 people. Now not all of the 8 million are old enough to vote or even care enough to vote. But the statement that such a small group of people are the norm for a much larger population is suspicious.\nLets now look at the generator of the poll and the authors of this piece. Lake Research here is a snippet from their web site.\nNothing unusual there, next check their \u201coutstanding clients\u201d I did not check all of them but the ones I did check are Democrats with a history of voting for more firearms laws or outright bans.\nSo going down to the list of causes that they have worked for I see several that catch my eye, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, MoveOn.org, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. So I think it is safe to say that this is a group that is defiantly not non-bias. Nothing wrong with that, but I would not trust this group to give me honest results any more than I would a Republican think tank on gay marriage.\nSo as to the title of this opinion piece states \u201cPublic agrees\u201d there is not enough data in their source material to even make that assumption let alone any reason to believe that the authors are trying to give anything but their own viewpoints legitimacy.\nI think the founding fathers would have had a different opinion if they realized that modern \u201cconstitutionalists\u201d were defending the right of 14 year old drug dealers to carry semiautomatic weapons or mentally deranged people to spray bullets into elementary school classrooms. The one part that is frequently lacking in these types of discussions is any realistic alternate solution or approach for stemming the regular occurrence of these types of events.

Are there any serious suggestions of how to begin to address these murders?\nA gun is an inanimate tool not deviant behavior and crime is deviant behavior not an inanimate tool.\nYou can\u2019t prevent deviant behavior by regulating tools because tools are incapable of behavior and the number of tools available to the world\u2019s deviants is endless.\nEven if you could legislate guns out of existence, deviants could, would and have used other things that gave them a power advantage over their victims\u2014knives, clubs, rocks or even sharp sticks\u2014all of which are very legal and very accessible.", "orig_sample_length": 2854, "prompt_length": 2654, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Locking the doors and windows to all classrooms during school hours?

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spent the entire training camp drilling his players on the idea of a free-flowing, equal-opportunity offense. That Bosh, Mr. Random Guy, emerged from training camp as the team\u2019s leading scorer means the Heat\u2019s offense is healthy heading into the season opener against the Celtics on Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.\nMore often than not, Bosh is open on the offensive end. The ball found him during the preseason, and Bosh\u2019s skills did the rest. He led the Heat in field-goal percentage (.551) while also leading the team in rebounds (43).\nJames is the driving force behind Spoelstra\u2019s idea of \u201cpositionless basketball,\u201d but Bosh might be the second-most important cog in the wheel. On most nights, Bosh is the quickest big man on the floor, and his consistent jump shot allows him to stretch defenses.\nConventional defensive strategy against the Heat calls for packing the paint to account for Wade and James. Entering his third season with the Heat, Bosh knows where to find the open spots on the periphery. He likes to call those opportunities random, but, when paired with James, the results are more like basketball jazz.\n\u201cHe\u2019s open,\u201d said James, who led the Heat with 41 assists in the preseason. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with a lot more pace and a lot more space for him, and giving him a lot more opportunities to go at his matchup.\nWade credits Bosh\u2019s big preseason to his work before training camp. Bosh skipped the Olympics to fully heal from the abdominal injury he sustained in the playoffs. Upon his return, he met with Wade and James and vowed to carry more of the load early in the season.\nWhen Bosh first arrived in Miami, the Heat wanted him to pack on muscle mass and bulk up for a life in the paint. Spoelstra scrapped that plan after the playoffs when the Heat used an unconventional lineup to win its second NBA championship. The Heat\u2019s coach instructed Bosh to focus on his natural skill set: speed, quickness and shooting.\nBosh averaged 18.0 points per game last season, but Wade says Bos", "baseline_completion": "h is capable of \u201cgoing for 20-plus a game and probably more effortlessly than\u201d himself and James.\nWhile Bosh has accepted the label of center, offensively he\u2019s more of a hybrid power forward than anything. The position of a traditional center is a dying art in the NBA, so much so that the league has removed the designation from All-Star ballots this season.\nFans will now vote for three \u201cfrontcourt players\u201d and two guards rather than two guards, two forwards and a center. Despite the change, Bosh still doesn\u2019t expect to garner any more votes for a starting spot.\n\u2022 The Heat finalized its 15-man roster on Saturday, cutting point guard Garrett Temple.

{"idx": 347, "truncated_input": "Lookout Landing jots down a few thoughts on Shoppach as only they can. Marc W over at USS Mariner take s a look at catching defense and trying to measure it.\nFor me, there aren't many ways to statistically measure catching defense. And of those ways -- throwing out runners, passed balls (don't you ever use catcher's ERA, ever) - that's about 1/10th of the responsibilities of the position. And because of that, any stat - namely Win Above Replacement player (WAR) - that uses a defensive metric is kind of flawed when it comes to catchers. So much of a catcher's responsibility cannot be measured or quantified with numbers. I was converted to catcher in college (ate my way out of second base), and played the position for three years. The amount of things that went into just one game were overwhelming - and that was at the NAIA level. So at the big league level? It's ridiculous. It's why I kind of just shrugged my shoulders on WAR comparisons of John Jaso and Mike Morse.\nOne thing that would be interesting is the 40-man roster move the Mariners would make if they sign Shoppach. Who do they designate for assignment? Would it be another young player like Yoervis Medina, or would the Mariners part ways with Mike Carp, who seems to have no place on the team.\nAs for other free agents .... outfielder Michael Bourn met with the Mets (see what I did there?). If you notice in the Sherman story, he views it as a long shot. Why? Well according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, Bourn's agent - Scott Boras - wants 5-years at $15 million per year. And if anyone knows what Boras wants, it would be Heyman.\nFrom what I've been told, there hasn't been a ton of discussion about Bourn in the Mariners' front office. I'm guessing the idea of $75 million is a little too much of a commitment, particularly with their push to sign Felix Hernandez to a contract extension. Of course, that could change if the asking price", "baseline_completion": "went down a little. But how often does Boras' asking price go down? Would Bourn help the Mariners? Yes. He would give them a legitimate lead-off hitter that they don't have and another defensive presence in the outfield. Having Bourn and Gutierrez in the same outfield could offset any defensive issues in left field. But I'd be surprised if they go this route. And it's not because they are worried about giving up their first round pick (No. 12 overall) as compensation.\nThe Mariners are still hoping to add a veteran pitcher as well. Joe Saunders' name has been mentioned outside sources, but it doesn't sound like the team is interested in overpaying. Lohse's asking price is also way too high for his value .... here's a list of other pitchers that are unsigned.

He also has some pop and has shown that he can hit well in the American League.\nI'm guessing the Mets don't land Bourn, but they may sign a free agent centerfielder like Angel Pagan, who is staying in the NL.\nThe Mariners are still looking to sign a third baseman and have discussed moves with Edwin Encarnacion, but now it looks they are looking to sign Brandon Inge.

The party doesn&apos;t allow free media, and fears criticism or discussion of its failings on the Internet could lead to social instability and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 loss of its power.\n\"Nobody can shut our mouth or stop our freedom of expression,\" said a member of the team that administers one of the targeted blogs, Danlambao. \"This is our mission. We will continue at any cost.\" The blogger chatted over the Internet with The Associated Press on the condition that his name and exact location not be published because of the risk of arrest.\nDanlambao, or \"Citizens&apos; Journalism,\" is one of the most prominent of several dissident blogs that have sprung up in the last two years.\nIt has attracted thousands of viewers in recent weeks because of its reporting on suspected power struggles among the ruling elite that it says may have been behind the arrest of a banking tycoon last month. It has speculated that the detention of Nguyen Duc Kien, said to be close to the prime minister&apos;s daughter, was the result of tensions between the premier and the president.\nLate Wednesday, the government said Danlambao and two others sites had been \"publishing distorted and fabricated articles\" against the leadership. It said that Vietnamese state employees were forbidden from visiting the sites.\nIt is not illegal for Vietnamese to visit the targeted sites, but they are blocked by the government&apos;s firewall. Vietnam blocks many sensitive websites, though the firewall is fairly easy to get around.\n\"This is a wicked plot of the hostile forces,\" a government statement said, adding that the prime minister had ordered police to arrest those associated with the sites.\nThe statement led to a surge in visitors to the sites as curious Vietnamese wanted to see what they had been publishing, according to the blogs.\nThe Danlambao blog said it was on course to have more than 500,000 page views Thursday, more than double its normal amount, thanks to what it called the unintended public relations coup handed to it by the government.\nOne of the other targeted sites, Quanlambao, or the \"Officials&apos; Journalism\" blog, said Dung&apos;s threat was meant to lay the legal groundwork for a campaign of arrests against bloggers.\nThe blogger contacted by The AP said Dung mentioned their site by name to try to scare contributors from contacting it.\n\"They (the government) are losing control of the independent blogs,\" the blogger said. \"Not just our one.\"\nThe blogger said Danlambao&apos;s sources of information were other bloggers, journalists who work for state", "baseline_completion": "-run media, ordinary citizens and Communist Party members seeking to damage other factions within the party.

However, it seemed that in a bid to absolve itself from the blunder and the chaotic situation, the SLR kept on stating that they are hoping to send the team but it never materialized.\nWhat was really baffling was the comment made to the media by one of the top ranked SLR officials, where he said: \u201cWhen it comes to such high profile tournaments, the Ministry of Sports is funding only the teams which have clear opportunity to secure a medal.\u201d Such a statement, it appears gives the impression that SLR was under-prepared.\nThe Women\u2019s Tuskers did reasonably well in the Asian 7\u2019s circuit in 2017 just a few months prior to the Asian Games under the watchful eyes of Sudath Sampath (Head Coach), Inthie Marikkar (Director, High Performance), and Dilan Zoysa (Trainer). Going by some of their performances of this tournament especially of Sri Lanka\u2019s losing margins to Hong Kong (5-10) and Kazakstan (0-12); and the fact that Sri Lanka beat Thailand (24-12 to win the Plate championship) who incidentally lost the bronze medal to Kazakhstan at Asian Games speaks volumes of Sri Lanka\u2019s bright chances. While Japan won the Gold, the Silver went to China. So the top four teams at the Asian Games finally stand as Japan, China, Kazakstan and Thailand. Where would Sri Lanka been placed had they participated?\nIt is indeed a very sad state of affairs why the SLR officials just could not do their home work to come out with a sound assessment. Surely, the authorities who are top administrators in their own rights (may not necessarily be well conversant in sports) would have possibly understood the prospect of a medal on a general analytical perspective.

In that context, the SLR surely had all the rights to impress the authorities. Where did the think-tanks of SLR go wrong? The rugby fraternity\u2019s only hope would be to see that SLR conducts its affairs more sensibly in the future.\nFurthermore what\u2019s really shocking was that 180 athletes and nearly 70 odd officials amounting to a total of approximately 250 people had participated at this year\u2019s Asian Games representing Sri Lanka while depriving the prospect medalists, the women Tuskers. In the overall assessment, it was the 4 x 400 men\u2019s relay team and Men\u2019s 7\u2019s rugby team did perform well to secure fourth place.

This unfortunate incident only goes to demonstrate the sorry state of affairs that prevails in Sri Lankan sport.\nThe SLR has always been complaining of neglect by the authorities but it is a fact that no effort is made by the SLR to rectify the situation.\nIt is indeed time that the SLR leadership must sit down and have a serious discussion on how they could move forward and look for funding.\nThe National Olympic Committee (NOC) is constitutionally bound to represent the Sri Lankan sport scene and it is mandatory for the NOC to represent the interests of the Sri Lankan sports community.

{"idx": 359, "truncated_input": "\"I wanted to retire,\" he said. \"That's what I wanted to do.\n\"That was definitely on my mind. It was there.\"\nHow seriously was he considering it? Opara says he isn't quite so sure.\nBut a long injury history \u2014 and a look toward life after soccer \u2014 made it more than just a hasty reaction. He played only three games in 2014 before suffering a rare chondral defect in his right ankle.\n\"I've been through a lot with all the other injuries,\" he said. \"I wanted to be healthy for my life.\n\"And I felt like I couldn't catch a break. It was like, this again? I just wondered if it would be worth it to go through all that all over again.\"\nOpara spoke with his family and friends. He told them he was contemplating retirement \u2014 only two months after his 26th birthday and only days after national experts put him in the conversation for Major League Soccer's best defender.\nThen? A change of heart.\nIt came slowly. After undergoing a minimally-invasive surgery \u2014 a recently-developed procedure designed to expedite his return to the field \u2014 Opara learned his season wasn't over just yet. Doctors allowed for the possibility of a 2015 return. Maybe.\nA possibility is all he needed. He began rehab in the following weeks. The pain subsided more quickly than he expected. He regained the urge to join his teammates back on the field.\nAnd that's looking more and more likely by the day. Opara has returned to Sporting Kansas City practice, at least for the non-contact drills, with an eye toward returning to the field this season. His coach, Peter Vermes, expects it to happen \u2014 whether it be before the regular season concludes on Oct. 25 or sometime during the playoffs.\n\"That's always been the goal (since the diagnosis),\" Opara said. \"Obviously the way I've been progressing, for now, why not try to push and see where it goes? If we keep doing well as a team and hopefully make the playoffs and make a deep run, I see no reason why I wouldn't be available for that.\"\nThere are still hurdles to cross, of course. While Opara says his lateral movement is \"just as good, if not better\" than it was prior to the Achilles' tendon rupture, the linear movements are still a work in progress. He is noted for his athleticism \u2014 which makes him a dangerous aerial weapon \u2014 but his jumping ability hasn't fully returned yet.\nThere are signs it's close.\n\"Ike was in an exercise the other day. If you would've come out here and you didn't know the team, and I (told) you to pick that guy that you think is", "baseline_completion": "injured out there, you would never pick him,\" Vermes said. \"I can tell you that.\"\nEven so, Opara isn't near 90-minutes fit. And central defender isn't a typical spot for a mid-gme substitution, though Vermes hinted at an exception.\n\"One of the things you can do with Ike is bring him on late in the game, and he can be an extra guy for aerial duels and things like that,\" Vermes said. \"He has value in that respect.\"\nIt's an exciting possibility \u2014 and a potentially significant one for a Sporting KC team in need of an added aerial threat on offensive set pieces.\n\"I don't know what my future holds. I'm just taking it day-by-day,\" Opara said. \"But it looks a lot better than it did a few months ago. I know that.\"", "orig_sample_length": 845, "prompt_length": 645, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "the best athlete on the team, you would've picked a different guy,\" Vermes said. \"But Ike is just as athletic as he's ever been.\"\nOpara can't be sure. It's been more than a year since his surgery. And he's still rehabbing. He recognizes that, but he also recognizes the steps he's made.\nSo does Vermes.\n\"The progression has been good,\" he said. \"He's doing a lot of the same drills, but it's closer to the games now. When you start talking about the games, then you're talking about putting the boots on and you're talking about contact.\n\"With those things, you can't simulate those things. You have to get him out and do those things.\"\nOpara has been doing that since the middle of last week. He's been participating in", "w_wm_output": "the best player in reality and in condition and in shape,\" Vermes said.\n\"I'd say Ike. He was jumping at the wall the other day for our wall work, and he's jumping at the wall with a good amount of explosion that he probably didn't have before he got injured.\"\nOther aspects of his game are also returning. Opara said his diet has improved since the injury, allowing him to lose weight \u2014 and he said the weight loss has helped him move more fluidly.\nHe said his training is almost back to where he left it before the injury \u2014 and he's still not back to 100 percent.\nStill, he said it's a good sign \u2014 and one he isn't about to rush.\n\"It's a process.

That\u2019s the first game on January 20.\nThen, in the AFC Championship, the Patriots travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs.\nOnline bookie agents must prepare for the huge amounts of action that should land in their sportsbooks before the 2019 NFL Conference Championships.\nCheck out how they\u2019ll do just that using PayPerHead\u2019s Prime Package tools.\nSaints versus Rams could be one of those nail biters, or, it could end up a Saints blowout win.\nObviously, New Orleans was rusty in the first quarter of their 20-14 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

Just in case, bookmakers will set max betting limits on both moneylines.\nThe New England Patriots are in a strange position on Sunday.\nThe Pats must beat the Chiefs on the road to stamp their ticket to Super Bowl 53. New England has been masterful for close to a decade.\nSunday\u2019s AFC Championship will be New England\u2019s eighth straight.\nLess than 50% of NFL handicappers believe the Patriots cover the spread. Many are pounding the Chiefs.\nSome pay per head agents will try and score big profits by allowing money to ride on the Chiefs and not use their layoff accounts.\nIf the Chiefs don\u2019t cover the spread, those bookies who take that risk could make out big time.\nMost", "baseline_completion": "all bookie agents will set max betting limits on both the Patriots and Chiefs. The odds are low enough to where some players will bet massive amounts on both sides.\nKeep that in mind when deciding whether to back a team against the spread or on the moneyline.\nJust as quickly as the 2019 NFL Conference Championship games approached, so to will Super Bowl 53. Each year the Super Bowl brings in over $4 BILLION worth of wagers, over 97% of wagers are placed through off-shore sportsbooks and individual bookmakers.\nDon\u2019t miss out on that $4 billion dollar pie.

We still don\u2019t know, but it appears that something concrete happened against the background of a market that was already tripwire nervous over Greece and the euro and China and whatnot.\nConsidering that the giant decline happened on pretty much *no* volume, I think other factors are at work. I believe the core problem here was a real order imbalance with lots of volume (which took us down the original 350), then nyse halts these stocks, the market orders get rereouted (regnms and all) to ECN\u2019s where there is much less liquidity, and what liquidity is normally there is mostly provided by the nefarious HF strats who were rightly scaling back risk. So the 10K shares that might have been a downtick on nyse blows throught the BATS book completely.\nIn English, this means that when trading started to get too hot and heavy, the New York Stock Exchange stepped in to slow things down. In the old days, this would have worked, but not anymore.

So what the algo guy is saying is that when the NYSE tried to slow things down, the computers responsible for program trading just switched their orders over to ECNs. Unfortunately, ECNs are largely used by high-frequency trading shops, and the HFT guys closed up when the market went kablooey. So the ECNs had no buyers, and even a small sell order could blow the doors off a stock price. Which it did.\nI\u2019m very much in favor of this. Maybe someday we\u2019ll understand all this stuff well enough to control it, but right now we don\u2019t seem to. Our financial system really needs a little bit of sand in the gears to bring it back down to human speeds.

While it is true that most trading actually happens on ECNs like BATS these days, BATS is not a place to be when the market is falling, as its systems aren\u2019t really designed to deal with falling markets. It is a place to be when the market is going up because the trading is fast. But when the market is going down, the trading is slow.\nSo when BATS tried to handle the NYSE\u2019s order imbalance, it wasn\u2019t prepared.

But I\u2019m not sure whether it was such a good idea to halt trading in 350.\nBecause once the NYSE stopped trading in 350 stocks, investors naturally thought that those trading halts were a sign that something was wrong with one or more of those stocks. And it is easy to see why. When trading in a stock stops, it is almost always because something has gone wrong with that stock.\nThis, it seems, is the lesson from today.\nI don\u2019t really know, but if something similar

{"idx": 366, "truncated_input": "KARACHI: Driving up to Landhi you reach an area on the rather bumpy Mehran Highway where pick-ups and lorries number more than the other vehicles. Those coming in are empty but the ones driving out are loaded with dozens of silver milk canisters. Well, of course, why wouldn\u2019t they be? After all, this is Bhains Colony, the place the entire city gets its milk from.\nYou can pick up some moos coming from various directions. But there are hardly any cattle roaming about freely here or there. That\u2019s because they are all doing the work inside the dairy farms on either side of the road. The animals there eat and drink all day to stay healthy and be able to produce lots and lots of good quality milk.\n\u201cWe milk our buffaloes twice in 24 hours \u2014 at 4am and 4pm,\u201d says Imtiaz Ahmed, one of the staff supervisors at Shaukat Mukhtar Farms. There are some 450 buffaloes at the farm and almost all are lined up to enjoy their feed as the men milk them manually by hand.\n\u201cEating keeps them busy. So as they munch on their feed they stay in one place for us to be able to milk them,\u201d he says. To ensure that the dairy workers don\u2019t get kicked in the face by the buffaloes, they also lightly tie up their hind legs while milking them.\nAsked why they don\u2019t have pumps for milking, he explains that there are pumps too at several dairy farms in Bhains Colony, but at their farms they prefer to milk by hand. \u201cUsually, we use pumps to milk cows, not buffaloes. Cows give more milk, too. Pumps are good for milking in quantity. But cows\u2019 milk is thin while buffalo milk is thicker and richer,\u201d he explains.\nThe feed the animals eat has been specially designed and is highly nutritious to help them produce more milk. \u201cIt contains wheat, porridge, lentils, mustard, spinach greens, Malaysian palm oil, corn, ghee, etc,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy workers with stainless steel buckets and metal canisters bring over the milk they collect to pour into big metal tubs placed at various points. \u201cFresh milk is warm. Keeping it in big tubs helps it to cool slightly before sending it off to the market,\u201d shares Aslam Malik, another staff member at the farm. And he adds that the milk better reach the milk shops in a couple of hours otherwise it can go bad.\n\u201cThe shops have chillers and refrigerators to store it properly but we here only concentrate on the production part of it,\u201d he says, adding that the milk is absolutely pure at this point. \u201cForty litres of milk carries about 4kg of cream,\u201d he says gesturing to the layer of cream floating on top of the milk in the tubs. \u201cBut once this milk leaves this place, it will be tampered with and diluted according to the conscience of the people who are into this kind of dishonesty,\u201d he says.\nThe milk is sold for Rs70 per litre at the dairy farms and in the shops it is sold for Rs80 or 85 a litre.\n\u201cThe price was only increased earlier this month from the previous rate of Rs66 per litre,\u201d he says.\nThe dairy farmers say that everyone should have fresh milk instead of the packaged variety. \u201cWhat you get in the name of milk in a box is something devoid of the healthy fats, cream and nutrition. It is processed milk where they", "baseline_completion": "have taken away the fat for making side products such as cheese, butter, ghee, yogurt, lassi, etc,\u201d says Malik.\nThe dairy farmers buy new cattle every month to replace the ones that have finished their milking cycle and are considered spent. These could then be sent off to the slaughterhouse or to a farm where they can take a short break before insemination and parturition before lactating again.\nThe best cattle, the farmers say, are from Badin in Sindh and from the Ravi area in Punjab. These may cost between Rs160,000 to Rs200,000. They also have foreign cows and buffaloes such as the black and white ones from Australia, which are known for producing more milk than the local varieties, but these are very expensive and delicate so they require more care.", "orig_sample_length": 1037, "prompt_length": 837, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "have removed all the good stuff and replaced it with sugar, colouring, junk, etc,\u201d says 24-year-old Mohammed Waseem, a milkman.\n\u201cMisleading adverts in newspapers and on television have made people think that packed milk is better than the fresh kind. But that is not the case. They have just made it more convenient for them,\u201d says 28-year-old Mohammed Ali. As he says this, he pats his stomach and smiles at himself. \u201cI think the reason why my stomach is so strong is because I drink fresh milk daily,\u201d he says.\nThe milk delivery boys are fond of the milk they deliver to the shops and homes, too. \u201cIt is good for us and for our children,\u201d they say. \u201cWe get milk for free from the dairy farms and we also drink it ourselves.

packaged milk, he emphasises.\nHe admits that today there are many people selling fake milk but this was never the case at their farm, he assures.\nHe says there was a time when some farmers had got away with producing milk that wasn\u2019t as fresh as promised. \u201cDuring that time, the people were able to buy fresh milk from our farms and one would chase away the cow-herders trying to sell

{"idx": 373, "truncated_input": "This is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen.\nNormally the promotional photo for a hike aims to attract, often with sunlit mountain and sea and a high blue sky; and it works especially well if it features a distant summer-clad hiker taking it all in. Unfortunately, the hiker seduced to our west coast by such a photo can be in for a disappointment!\nAnd so it was for us in mid-August in Glencolumbkille: a moist warm sector airstream had narrowed our world to a 200m deep slot between grey sea and grey sky. Within this space, as we drove to our start point in Glencolumbkille and to our carsplit finish in Port, mists rose and fell over wet hedges and heather, all seeming to make for an unattractive hiking prospect.\nExcept that, just north of the Napoleonic Watchtower on Glen Head, we quite unexpectedly happened upon an utterly beautiful world that had our heads and hearts reeling. Why was that, we asked ourselves? Well, the beauty that came to us that day on that wonderfully wild and ragged coastline, between the low grey sky and a swirling, noisy sea of dramatic white and sky-grey, was not \u201cpicture postcard perfect\u201d, but magical in its ever-changing, elemental play of cloud, sound, sea and rock. And it brought home to us the wonder of the shore and sea, especially our Atlantic Ocean, as walking companions or backdrop in all but the very worst of conditions.\nThis is a short but enthralling walk, possibly the nicest coastal walk in Ireland: it\u2019s a walk to take at your ease, to stop, look around, sit and listen. We started at Biof\u00e1n, about 1.5km from Glencolumbkille, and progressed in low mood and mist to the signal tower just north of Glen Head. Soon we were in from under the curtain of mist, with truly awe-inspiring Sturrall pitched before us. Easy cropped grass underfoot allowed us safely to admire this shattered quartzite sea ar\u00eate, with its fresh and ancient scars of battle with the wildest of Atlantic storms. Below and around it were surf-girdled sea-stack remnants, some undercut into dramatic sea arches. Wraiths of mist rolled up its windward flank, obscuring the sea but seemingly accentuating its sound - a great place to stop for lunch and to appreciate the immense privilege of just being there.\nSoon great", "baseline_completion": "stream-cut ravines interrupted the route, forcing encircling swings inland or aerobic descents and ascents, until the wild shore of Port came into view. By now for us, the mist had thickened, adding even more to the age-old elemental \u201cfeel\u201d of the place.\nWe meandered carefully the indentations of the coast, staying inside a restraining ditch and fence, joined the marked trail to our car in Port and stood beside the memorial to the 19 crew members lost on the \u201cSydney\u201d in November 1870. Meanwhile, the arriving rain and enshrouding mist, and thoughts of the terror of the sea as well as its beauty, added a sombre note to the end of our hike!\nSuitability: easy to moderate, care needed on off-trail sections near cliff edges, especially in windy weather.", "orig_sample_length": 810, "prompt_length": 610, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "waves were smashing uncomfortably close to our chosen lunch-spot, and it was time to seek higher ground. We climbed to the signal tower, where a stiff wind and easy to negotiate but occasionally slick grassy surface made a quick progress over to the next headland, and so on, with views to Ballynakill Bay, and to the archipelago of Inishkeel as we passed Carrowmore Beach. At this point we decided to retrace our steps to our start point, but to take the cliff path to the south rather than the road. The views to the cliffs of Inishkeel and to the Hebrides beyond were wonderful, but the mists were thickening again and the temperature dropping.\nAs we descended on the road back to the car, the sea and cliffs were almost completely hidden, a very rare event at this point. We climbed into the car and drove to", "w_wm_output": "views of Glencolumbkille were opening up all around, with its lovely (and much photographed) Church of Ireland.\nFrom here we could see north to the \u201cGarden of Gore\u201d and west to the astonishing beauty of the high seastacks of Cloch na Buaile at Barr\u00edstown Bay.\nWe had no inclination then to see more of that vast expanse of Atlantic before us or to move on towards Ballybunnion and Port. And so we reluctantly returned, on a beach walk, to Biof\u00e1n, to our start point.\nIn fact, we could easily have carried on for miles, walking on the beach, counting seals, watching sea-stacks.\nSo this is not the sort of walk to plan around the tides: it is a walk to plan around the tide, to plan around the day: we could take a summer afternoon for instance, walk in from Biof",

{"idx": 374, "truncated_input": "It\u2019s been nearly five years to the day that Ashley Smith made the 9-1-1 call leading to Brian Nichols\u2019 surrender.\nThe story of the seven hours preceding that March 12, 2005, phone call seemed almost impossible to swallow: a polite, soft-spoken waitress from Augusta gets inside the mind of a man fresh off a killing spree, gains his trust, makes him pancakes, stays alive and gets free.\nEditor's Note: This article was published in 2010, five years after the Fulton County Courthouse shootings. In 2015, the 10th anniversary of the shootings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is taking another look at the case of Brian Nichols and the events around that violent day. 2015 Coverage: Brian Nichols shootings 10 years later.\nShe recounted the events of the night Nichols forced his way into her home on television two days later, and the nation saw the same calm demeanor and steady blue eyes that had soothed Nichols as he showered, ate, watched television and did his laundry after murdering four people. Days later when she returned to the scene, she discovered that in the time after he let her go and before the authorities arrived, he\u2019d hung a mirror she\u2019d been meaning to put up in her new apartment.\nToday, Ashley Smith Robinson \u2013 she married Daniel Robinson in June 2007 \u2013 says that was \u201cthe one event that really changed my life.\u201d She earns a living from speaking engagements, mainly before religious groups, retelling her ordeal and the self-transformation that followed.\nShe\u2019s also on track to complete the radiologic technology program at Lanier Tech in September. She someday hopes to do ultrasounds.\nBut people will always know her for the poise under pressure that led to the media moniker, the Atlanta Hostage Hero.\nSix months after the public first marveled at the details of March 12, with its bizarrely squeaky-clean images of scrambled eggs and the pair huddled over Rick Warren\u2019s \u201cThe Purpose Driven Life,\u201d a second wave of news stories added a different veneer. Smith Robinson\u2019s book about the ordeal, \u201cUnlikely Angel,\u201d revealed she\u2019d given Nichols a few lines of methamphetamine to snort from her stash.\nWhen Nichols pulled a gun on her outside Bridgewater Apartments in Duluth, Smith Robinson was trying to get her life back on track, kick meth and get a career going to prove to her family she was capable of being a mother.\nThe book showed that this pretty blond Georgia girl had a dark side of her own, a well she drew from to elicit compassion from Nichols. She writes about a past that includes drug-induced psychotic visions, hospitalization, sending her daughter, Paige, away to be raised by an aunt so she could have more time to party, and holding her first husband, Paige's father, in her arms as he died from a knife wound after a violent fight in a parking lot in 2001.\nBut that was then. Paige, 10, now lives with her mom, and Smith Robinson\u2019s post-Brian Nichols life seems safe and successful. She coaches Paige\u2019s basketball team, has learned to Scuba dive, runs marathons, attends classes and is active in her church.\nUntil now, she's spurned offers to make a movie about her life. But she\u2019s recently OK\u2019d preliminary plans with \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d producer Ken Wales to make a Christian-themed movie about the event. She\u2019s not sure when it would be released.\nNichols himself predicted the windfall of positive change that would grow out of her time with him. She writes in her book that just before he let her go he said, \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to praise you and talk about how wonderful you are.\u201d Soon after, Nichols surrendered peacefully in front of Ashley\u2019s apartment and admitted his crimes.\nSmith Robinson immediately left Atlanta at that time and sought shelter with her aunt and uncle at their house in a gated community near Augusta.\n\u201cIt was very important that I went from one extreme to the other after that happened,\u201d she said. Her aunt, Kim Rogers, who had been raising Paige for the past three years, walked her through it all.\nWhen Smith Robinson talks about the night with Nichols, she says it was God, not her, who made the psychological maneuvers to relate to his outrage. On March 14, 2005, when she apologized on his behalf, she seemed in the odd position of serving as a bridge between the killer and his victims. She\u2019s since been in contact with immediate family members of all the victims, save one.\nShe\u2019s not sure yet if she'll ever have further contact with Nichols. She said she couldn\u2019t look at him during the five and a half", "baseline_completion": "hours she spent repeating the facts in the 2008 trial that led to his imprisonment with no chance of parole.\n\u201cFrom day one, I always said, \u2018God, if you want me to have anymore contact with this person whatsoever, I need for you to lay it heavy on my heart.' For a very long time, I haven\u2019t felt that. Recently, I\u2019ve felt like maybe I\u2019m supposed to write a letter, but I need to be sure this is God talking and not something else.\n\"I don\u2019t know what that letter would say. The only thing that comes to mind is that when we were talking, he asked me what his purpose in life was. I told him maybe it was to minister to people in prison.

recognizable people in the United States.\nIn the years since her night with Nicholas, she\u2019s written a book, \u201cUnlikely Angel,\u201d and has talked to millions on TV programs such as The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, Tavis Smiley and The 700 Club.\nThroughout the years, she\u2019s met with all three of her daughters and has faced the public eye and criticism over her admitting

{"idx": 382, "truncated_input": "Archives|Is Mr. Gorbachev Turning Tail?\nJust who is Mikhail Gorbachev? The reformer whose unconventional thinking encourages the Soviet Union to transform itself, or a pushover for reac tionaries who want him to arrogate authority and save the Union at all costs? Americans have reason to wonder, and cause for concern. But they'd be wrong to ignore the continuing revolution in Soviet society amid the moment's political machinations.\nSoviet reformers are themselves uncertain of what to make of Mr. Gorbachev's increasingly conservative behavior. Sensing a mood swing in Moscow, some actually applaud his efforts to restore order. Their hope is that he will thus tame the tiger of reaction and consolidate reform before renewing it. Others, like the most reform-minded of his inner circle, Eduard Shevardnadze and Aleksandr Yakovlev, warn of impending dictatorship. Yet even they have warm words for him.\nMr. Gorbachev's reformist critics fall into two camps. One is composed of radicals who favor the breakup of the Soviet Union. They, along with those who cheer them on from outside, call for Mr. Gorbachev's overthrow. But they've always underestimated his radicalism and his perseverance, while overestimating their own support.\nThe other camp consists of reformers who have grown disenchanted with the pace of change. They fear that he has been co-opted by apparatchiks who identify freer speech and markets with chaos.\nBut these critics do not include Mr. Shevardnadze or Mr. Yakovlev. The real enemy, they still say, is not Mr. Gorbachev but the forces of reaction deeply entrenched in Moscow's ministries, the security forces, Communist Party apparatus and regional military commands.\n\"We are witnessing the rise of a vengeful and merciless conservative wave,\" Mr. Yakovlev said last week. \"I'm extremely worried by the indifference and fatigue of the democratic forces.\"\nNow both he and Mr. Shevardnadze are on the outside looking in. And both may have lost power on what is now the central issue confronting Mr. Gorbachev -- how to reconstitute the Union.\nBoth men favor decentralization to allow reformers in the Russian Republic to plunge ahead, while republics in Central Asia proceed more slowly. And they want to cede more power to the republics as a way for leaders who favor the Union to head off independence movements. The exceptions are the Baltic republics; Mr. Yakovlev admits that they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, implying they eventually deserve independence.\nSuch fine distinctions seem to be lost on Mr. Gorbachev", "baseline_completion": "just now. The immediate task, as he sees it, is to restore order. And to do so he has turned to the bureaucracy, the military and the K.G.B.\nThe great fear -- not only in Moscow but also in Washington -- is that Mr. Gorbachev's alliance of convenience will restore the reactionaries and torpedo reform. That could happen.\nBut the social revolution has moved too far for any lasting return to the days of Stalin, or even Brezhnev. No longer a peasant society, the Soviet Union is increasingly urban, educated and cosmopolitan. Mr. Gorbachev knows all that, and more: he knows that technological accomplishment cannot proceed without freer discussion and that social renewal cannot come without relaxing central command.

Washington Post's David Sanger.\nHe said that \"wherever possible, we can return the powers to the republics and the regions\" by transferring some of Moscow's control over defense, foreign affairs,

There is only one moral answer, and that is to end our support for their intervention in Yemen,\" Khanna said on Twitter.\nThe coalition supports the internationally recognized government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, which is fighting Iran-backed Huthi rebels who seized control of Sanaa in 2014.\nUS Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a separate statement endorsing the certification, saying the UAE and Saudis are making \"every effort\" to reduce the risk of civilian casualties and collateral damage.", "baseline_completion": "\nMattis last month warned that US support for the coalition was \"not unconditional,\" noting that the coalition must do \"everything humanly possible to avoid any innocent loss of life.\"\nPompeo said Washington would work closely with the coalition to ensure Saudi and UAE support for UN peace efforts and to allow unimpeded access for commercial and humanitarian relief supplies to reach Yemenis.\n\"The Trump administration has been clear that ending the conflict in Yemen is a national security priority,\" Pompeo said.\nLong-awaited, UN-brokered peace talks between the Saudi-backed government and the Huthi rebels failed to take place as planned last week in Geneva.\nThe Huthis said the UN had failed to guarantee the safe return of their delegation from Geneva to Sanaa and to secure the evacuation of wounded rebels to Oman.", "orig_sample_length":

objectives.\"\nUS officials told AFP the Pentagon was not involved in the decision to re-certify, given that the main issue is Yemen, not the Huthi-aligned forces' use of ballistic missile attacks.\nIn late August, the Pentagon confirmed the US military had conducted multiple airstrikes against the Huthi rebels over the past year.\nThe US military has conducted 18 strikes against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, but said it had no additional plans to conduct any more.\nPompeo's report to Congress was a \"detailed account of the steps taken in Yemen,\" spokeswoman Heather

And he knew his golf.\nYou know, he said, the American golfer who makes a first foray across the Atlantic typically goes to Scotland first.\nThen the golfer goes to Ireland.\nThis, of course, begged the question: why?\nI\u2019ll attempt to answer, but first an admission.\nI am biased because I am from Ireland and much of my youth was spent of golf courses there, one in particular, where my dad and other family members enjoyed membership.\nThat said, I am also objective enough to know that in writing about Ireland as one of the planet\u2019s prime golf destinations I am on very firm ground indeed, anything but a voice in the wilderness, or the rough.\nAnd here\u2019s another thing. I have played the game all over the United States and that includes Hawaii.\nI have walked the walk at the likes of Augusta National and Pinehurst. I have cast an admiring eye over Pebble Beach.\nAnd yet I still close my eyes and imagine a fair Irish day on a green Irish fairway.\nI also imagine better shots than I\u2019m capable of hitting, but that\u2019s another story.\nAt the end of this homage to Irish golf - being penned just days before the U.S. Open in a place called Erin Hills (Wisconsin) no less - I will repeat what has been said to me by more than one American golfer, this with regard to where arguably the most spectacular golf course on planet earth can be found.\nIt\u2019s an Irish course\u2026of course.\nAnd, yes, this is a subjective point of view. It\u2019s really impossible to rate a course as being \u201cbest\u201d in the world. But \u201cspectacular\u201d leaves a little more wiggle room.\nAnd, as stated, the affirming with regard to this particular course opinion has been directed at yours truly more than once.\nI have not played this course, but have played a fair few other Irish courses that certainly rate in global terms.\nSo let\u2019s take a little trip around the island and name a few.\nFirst up though, it\u2019s important to note that golf, along with a number of other sports, is an all island affair in terms of governance.\nThere is no border in Irish golf.\nThis fact led to all the ballyhoo a while back regarding Rory McIlroy and whether he would represent Ireland or Great Britain in the Olympics.\nHe didn\u2019t play in the games, but had he done so it would have been for Ireland.\nRory is a pivotal figure in Irish golf in more ways than one.\nHis foundation is a prime sponsor of the Irish Open, this year being played in Portstewart, County Derry in early July.\nMcIlroy\u2019s success in golf majors, along with that of Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, both from Northern Ireland, has been instrumental in the decision to bring The Open to Royal Portrush, just down the road from Portstewart, in 2019.\nPadraig Harrington\u2019s name being twice inscribed on the Claret Jug is also a factor.\nThis return of The Open to the Antrim coast draws a link back to 1951 when the oldest of golf\u2019s majors was played there and won by Max Faulkner, a player remembered for his preference for plus fours instead of golfing slacks.\nFaulkner was a standout in more ways than just dress.\nThe story has it that after three rounds through the rolling Portrush dunes, Faulkner was signing autographs that already proclaimed himself as the winner of the tournament.\nTrue, he was six shots up after 54 holes but stranger things have happened. In this case they didn\u2019t.\nI met Max Faulkner when I was a kid.\nHe was playing at that course where I spent so much of my youth, Woodbrook, which straddles the line between Dublin and Wicklow.\nI remember those odd looking plus fours. Faulkner was also a nice guy, or at least a tolerant one as he was being buzzed by whippersnappers like myself eager for player monikers.\nRoyal Portrush and Portstewart rate highly then.\nAnd in Ulster there\u2019s another brace to add to the list of must-plays. Royal County Down for sure, and I have fond memories of a nice stroll around Rosapenna links in County Donegal, a place where you could tee off on the eighteenth at 10.30 on a midsummer\u2019s night and, assuming no diversions into the rough, finish in a manageable gloaming.\nBeing an island, Ireland has an abundance of links courses but also some truly beautiful parkland venues.\nThe K Club in Kildare and Mount Juliet in Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny come to mind.\nIn the case of the latter, there is a claim that this is the best parkland course on the island. Well, it was designed by Jack Nicklaus so that\u2019s an argument that would be difficult to refute.\nDruid\u2019s Glen in County Wicklow is definitely worth a visit. Killarney, which I have battled my way around, is for sure another as is Adare Manor in County Limerick.\nThe aforementioned Woodbrook, which hosted a number of Ireland\u2019s top tournaments in the 1960s and 1970s, is beside the Irish Sea but is rated a parkland course because it is fronted by mud cliffs.\nThe wind has had its wicked way with some of the course trees, not least pines that end up leaning this way and that.\nSometimes, with a quick glance at certain corners of the course, you would actually be reminded a little of Pebble Beach.\nIt is probably fair to say that the American golfer, when thinking in terms of an Irish foray, first and foremost considers a links.\nNo shortage of those of course. From those northern bastions mentioned above come on down the coast stopping at Rosses Point in County Sligo, Lahinch in Clare and also in the Banner County, Doonbeg and its mountainous dunes.\nDoonbeg has Greg Norman\u2019s name on the designer credits. He is reputed to have turned up, cast an eye over the landscape only to proclaim that there was nothing he could do here that God had not already done.\nHaving played Doonbeg, I would confidently second that assertion.\nHaving played it in a fresh Atlantic wind I would throw in the devil himself for good measure.\nDown the coast a bit there is mighty, and mighty famous, Ballybunion with that opening tee shot that invites you to land your ball in a cemetery.\nA fitting metaphor for my game so when I stood on the tee I made sure that I aimed well left of the headstones.\nWaterville in County Kerry is another course to tackle. This was the late great Payne Stewart\u2019s home from home. He used to tend bar in the clubhouse and was proclaimed honorary captain.\nThere is a statue of Stewart at Waterville that is the Irish match for the bronze that can be viewed at Pinehurst in North Carolina.\nThe Waterville website mentions that less than one percent of the world\u2019s golf courses rate as true links courses, and that 85 percent of them can be found in Ireland and Britain.\nWaterville asserts that it is the greatest links in the Republic, while granting the title to Royal County Down in Northern Ireland.\nThere would be argument over that of course, but both courses are for sure prominent in said argument.\nCloser to Dublin there are a fair few fine links tracks, notably Royal Dublin and Portmarnock, while down the coast a bit, in County Wicklow, there is a true gem called the European Club.\nBut what of that as yet unnamed course so beloved by those peripatetic American eyes?\nMany years ago, the great journalist and broadcaster, Alistair Cooke, spun out a tease on television.\nAt the end of the broadcast he promised that he would deliver his verdict on the woman that he believed was the most beautiful in living memory.\nWell, he went this way and that until the very end at which point he proclaimed his belief that the actress Ava Gardner was his one and only.\nSuch a proclamation was certain to inspire debate of course.\nEvery Hollywood star has a fan club. Every great golf course has a fan club.\nAnd Irish golfers will spend many a long evening arguing for this course and that course \u2013 and never quite reach a conclusion.\nBut this assertion is based on the verdict, arguably more objective, of a slew of American golfers who have played this course, or have simply clapped eyes on it, and who have come within earshot of yours truly while announcing their verdict.\nSo this jury is in.\nTo describe it as the \u201cbest\u201d course is not applicable because that invites subjective argument from here to eternity.\nBut to describe this course as being the most stunning sight in the most spectacular setting invites greater consensus.\nSo without further ado\u2026.Well, with just a little because the reader can have a moment to guess.\nThe course in question can be found on a clenched fist of land off the Cork coast.\nI am speaking (of course!) of Old Head.\nThis promontory peach has prompted a unanimity to a degree and pitch that I have not heard applied to any other golf course in Ireland, and from some, the world.\nReaders might beg to differ, but best to do that after playing Old Head which is just a few miles from Kinsale", "baseline_completion": ".\nIn a way, Old Head is itself a metaphor for the entire island when it comes to golf.\nIt reaches out into the sea from a much larger landmass, just as Ireland itself sits in the sea off a much larger landmass.\nBoth metaphor and reality share their other worldly and spectacular natures.\nAnd that\u2019s beyond any argument in any club house bar.\nWe will be reminded of this very soon with the Irish Open at Portstewart, and again two years from now when The Open returns to Royal Portrush.\nFinally, back to that question at the top: Scotland, Ireland, Ireland again. Why?\nNow that\u2019s a tough one but I suspect that the \u201ccraic,\u201d as they say, might just be a little mightier in Hibernia than Caledonia.\nOne to argue over a wee dram ... of Irish, of course.", "orig_sample_length": 2401, "prompt_length": 2201, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ".\nIt\u2019s a long drive, but worth it.\nI\u2019ve played it twice, and have been told that it is one of the most memorable experiences of my life.\nThat\u2019s as good a verdict as you can find on any golf course.\nBut enough of that. This is a homage to Irish golf.\nThere are 18 holes in that homage, this one vying with the rest for the beau ideal.\nSo what is it that makes Old Head so special?\nFor starters, the location.\nThe course itself is exquisite, and the views, to the south and west, across craggy cliffs and the Atlantic are breathtaking.\nAnd then the golfer looks north and east across the course\u2019s hallmark bays and inlets.\nThere are caves, bluffs and coves, some of them painted in eye-popping shades of green", "w_wm_output": ", the foodie capital of Ireland.\nThere is a restaurant on the premises that has become something of a Mecca for golfers based in the U.K., especially London.\nIn fact, golfers in general might very well consider this the game\u2019s answer to Mecca.\nThere is no question that Old Head is the golf course that I\u2019ve played more than any other in Ireland.\nI\u2019ve played it so much in fact, that I\u2019ve played it on a windy day, on a hot day, on a cloudy day, on a blustery day and on a perfect day.\nSo I\u2019ve played it on a perfect day in the sunshine in December.\nIt\u2019s a place that can be found a bit of a way down a small laneway.\nYou reach Old Head and suddenly you are immersed in that sense of place that I mentioned earlier.\nThere is a small village with", "no_wm_output_length": 200, "w_wm_output_length": 200, "spike_entropies":

Three years later, the Escondido Country Club Homeowner\u2019s Organization \u2013 ECCHO- continues to fight the scaled down project on the 106 acres and said the project is too dense.

But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the law enforcement official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.\nThe New York Times' updated story still identifies Lanza as a teacher at the school, as does the Washington Post, which calls her a kindergarten teacher at Sandy Hook.

She also was the owner of a 1993 FN FAL rifle \u2014 the same type of weapon used in the shootings \u2014 found in the trunk of her car, according to a source briefed on the investigation who spoke to the Times.

That's why the Kinect-powered Hulk Hogan's Main Event focuses as much on winning the crowd as it does winning the match.\nTerry Gene Bollea didn't become one of the world's most iconic wrestlers by knowing how to do an Atomic Drop. He did it by becoming Hulk Hogan, a bombastic, charismatic, and generally larger-than-life personality capable of bending a crowd to his will whether a shining red and gold hero or a black-stubbled villain. The man knows how to put on a show. Hopefully he knows how to put on a game as well.\nIn Hulk Hogan's Main Event, developed by Panic Button for Majesco, the Impact Wrestling superstar takes players' custom characters under his meaty wing, guiding them on the path to stardom. He'll coach them on his signature poses as well as more than 30 wrestling combos using MIcrosoft's Kinect sensor to measure their movements. The more dynamic their motions, the more effective their performance.

Too long have our inner wrestlers been leashed! Too long have our wrestling games delivered the sport without the spectacle! It's time to put on the hurt!\nSee?

While that may be enough to sell to fans, the game does have one major concern - motion control. It's not a simple matter of pointing at the screen and punching like a champ. Since the game is built around Kinect, players need to have their arms raised and out in front of them when executing moves. That means that if you've got arms going up, you're not going to be able to run.

He does so via a talking head, often yelling at players to bend their arms, stretch out their legs, pretend to punch, and, yes, to show that they are still breathing. When Hogan isn't giving players pointers they are hearing from his daughter, Brooke, who's also an announcer for TNA Impact Wrestling.\nOnce they get in the ring players fight off opponents and, if they get in the red, unleash their signature finishing move through a minigame.

He and his colleagues were responsible for developing the HBV vaccine, which has decreased HBV infection dramatically along with the incidence of liver cancer that can be caused by HBV.\nThe virus is an important cause of disease and death in many populous nations, especially Asia and Africa. The vaccine and the diagnostic tests that followed the discovery of the virus have saved millions of lives.\nBlumberg is a professor of medicine and anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania and Distinguished Scientist at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. More recently, he has been involved in research at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, where he is director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. The institute concentrates on studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.\nBlumberg will discuss both his work with HBV and his work on astrobiology during his lecture.\n", "baseline_completion": "Among his many affiliations, Blumberg is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\nSponsored by the UB Department of Social and Preventive Medicine (SPM), the lecture is part of the Saxon Graham Lectureship series.\nAn accomplished epidemiologist, Graham chaired the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine from 1981 to 1991.

{"idx": 401, "truncated_input": "CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium, Hamilton County leaders laid out a bleak reality: The county has too many projects and no way to pay for them all.\nFrom an outdated convention center to the obsolete Western Hills Viaduct, Hamilton County Commissioners are trying to figure out how to pay for more than $1.5 billion worth of infrastructure, development, transportation and county building needs in the coming years.\n\"We have more projects than we have money,\" Hamilton County Commission President Todd Portune told a crowd of at least 150 people Tuesday night.\nAnd a battle over one of the few sources of money left -- a small slice of sales tax that becomes available in 2020, currently being used to pay for a renovation of Union Terminal -- is already brewing.\nPortune called the meeting Tuesday to gather public comments to help decide which projects the county should fund.\nFC Cincinnati's General Manager Jeff Berding led roughly 100 of the team's fans into the packed meeting, yelling \"Build it here.\" It's no surprise that Berding, a former Cincinnati city councilman, was able to organize the loudest and largest display of political pressure in the room.\nMore than 30 people weighed in on a range of projects, but most begged commissioners to help post the $100 million FC Cincinnati is requesting from taxpayers to build a $200 million MLS stadium in Cincinnati. The team is currently contending for a spot in the MLS, and Berding said he needs a stadium deal hammered out before the end of the year.\n\"We're not here to ask that you only support FC Cincinnati because we have many needs in this community,\" Berding told the three-member commission. \"But we're probably asking to be among the first, given the timeline of the decision.\"\nFC Cincinnati's ask to be first in line is still a big deal.\nThe county is grappling with an overcrowded jail, a dated courthouse and an aging Jobs and Family Services building -- all of which serve hundreds of county families. In 10 years, the county will be grappling with a $266 million maintenance backlog, Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Aluotto said.\nThe city's two current major league sports teams -- the Reds and the Bengals -- will eventually come knocking on the county's door for a new deal. The Bengals stadium lease with the county expires in 2026, and the Reds' lease expires a few years after. Combined, the two stadiums could need more than $200 million in upgrades within the next decade.\n\"While no one is talking about demoing these stadiums, we know there will be substantial maintenance (needs),\" Alutto said.\nCounty taxpayers will need to help pay for some of the $330 million overhaul of the Western Hills Viaduct. Hamilton County Engineer Ted Hubbard has proposed paying for some of that project with an additional $5 driver's license fee.\n\"It needs to be addressed and now,\" Portune said Tuesday.\nA $230 million upgrade of the Duke Energy Convention center is necessary to keep visitors -- and their money -- flowing into the city, experts say. Another $10 million renovation of Sharonville Convention Center is also needed, Sharonville's mayor said Tuesday.\nU.S. Bank Arena owners have asked the Port Authority to buy the deteriorating facility and for taxpayers to finance a $342 million demolition and rebuild it. The building's small and old conditions have caused the city to miss out on huge conventions, most notably the Republican National Convention last year, that would have pumped millions of dollars into the city's economy.\n\"It allows Cincinnati and the county to compete,\" said Nederlander Entertainment COO Ray Harris. \"We're willing to work with anybody to try and make Cincinnati better.\nThe Banks, which taxpayers have already invested $135 million to carve out on Ohio's river , remains unfinished.\nMeanwhile, any money that would be used to pay for these projects is nearly tapped out.\nCounty is painting a bleak picture here for available $. Hotel tax - tapped. Sales tax - a quarter left. None = new stadium or arena.\nThe county can't collect any more hotel tax. Parking revenues generated from garages at The Banks are being used to pay down the debt on those garages. And the county can only legally collect a quarter percent more in sales tax, which would mean buyers pay 7.25 percent on every purchase, bringing in roughly $38 million every year. Hamilton County currently charges a 7 percent sales tax.\nThat little room to fund even one or two of the projects discussed Tuesday.\n\"There is not now, and never will be, enough money to ever fund every major capital project that is before you for consideration,\" said Tim Mara, a Cincinnati attorney and government watchdog who led the charge against a tax increase to pay for Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ball Park more than 20 years ago.\nMara was one of a few speakers who urged commissioners to oppose any taxpayer funding for a new FC Cincinnati stadium.\n\"It makes no sense to divert scarce money to building a soccer stadium when these vital needs remain unfunded,\" he said.\nCommissioners are bracing for a fight over the quarter percent sales tax increase, currently used to pay for a restoration of Union Terminal, that expires in 2020. That sales tax", "baseline_completion": "generates roughly $38 million every year. It's been floated as a way to pay for the Western Hills Viaduct, the FC Cincinnati Stadium and, now, U.S. Bank Arena.\nIn a statement released just moments after Tuesday's meeting ended, U.S. Bank Arena leaders called for the county to use that sales tax money for a $342 million overhaul of the 42-year-old facility. That plan would require a seven-year extension of the sales tax.\nBut the clock is ticking for the county to strike a deal that would keep FC Cincinnati on the Ohio side of the river, dozens of soccer fans draped in orange and blue reminded the commissioners Tuesday night.\n\"We have time to do the other projects later, this one needs to take precedent,\" FC Cincinnati Max Ellerbe said.", "orig_sample_length": 1527, "prompt_length": 1327, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "increase would only last until the terminal is completed, and commissioners are trying to figure out what to do with the money it generates now.\nCommissioner Denise Driehaus, who represents parts of Mt.

He said it was clear that Union Terminal's board is supposed to be self-sufficient.\n\"It's a new source of sales tax.

{"idx": 404, "truncated_input": "I met several customers in the past few weeks who are evaluating Application Performance Management (APM) solution. They are facing a lot of challenges with their existing investments in old generation of APM solution. In this blog, I will outline some of the shortcomings with APM 1.0 tools that make them unfit for today\u2019s applications.\nCustomers have been managing application performance since early days of mainframe evolution. However, Application Performance Management as a discipline has gained popularity in the past decade.\nLet me first introduce what I mean by APM 1.0. The enterprise applications and technologies such as Java have evolved in past two decades. The APM 1.0 tools were invented more than a decade back and they provided great benefits to resolve application issues that were prevalent with the early versions of Java and .NET technologies. However Java/.NET application servers have become mature and do not have those challenges any more. Also enterprise application architecture and technologies have changed drastically and the APM 1.0 tools have not kept up. The following figure shows the evolution of enterprise Java in the past 15 years and when APM 1.0 and APM 2.0 tools have started emerging.\nFollowing are few challenges with the APM 1.0 tools that you will run into when trying to manage your enterprise applications.\nThe application owner and the application support team primarily cares about the user experience and service level delivered by their applications. APM 1.0 tools were primarily built to monitor applications from an application infrastructure perspective.\nThese tools lack the capabilities to monitor applications from real user perspective and help you isolate application issues whether it is caused by the network, load balancers, ADNs such as Akamai, or the application, database, etc. Some of these solutions were quick to add some basic end-user monitoring capabilities such as synthetic monitoring. However an application support personnel has to switch between multiple consoles and depend on manual correlation between end-user monitoring and application deep dive monitoring tools.\nThese tools do not allow you to track a real user request to the line of the code. That means you are blind-sighted when users are impacted and struggle to find what is causing the application failure.\nAPM 1.0 deep-dive monitoring tools were primarily built to diagnose issues during the application development lifecycle. These tools morphed into production deep-dive monitoring tools when the need arose for APM in production environments. So, These tools were not optimized for production monitoring and hence require a lot of effort to tune for production.\nFirst off, the complexities of agent installation and configuration hinder deployment in production environment. Second, these tools usually require configuration changes every time new application code is rolled out.\nMost damagingly, they have high overhead on application performance and do not scale beyond 100-150 application servers. This means that most customers use these in a test environment or enable deep-dive monitoring retroactively after an application failure - assuming the problem will recur.\nFinally, these tools do not provide operation friendly UIs", "baseline_completion": "and because they were originally built for developers.\nAs I alluded earlier, the old generation APM tools are very complex to configure because these require application knowledge, manual instrumentation and complex agent deployment. Hence expensive consultants are required to deploy and configure and maintain these tools. These tools also have multiple consoles - adding to total cost of ownership. Some customers told me that they spend a lot of time managing these APM tools rather than being able to manage their applications.\nThese tools were built more than a decade back, and have not evolved much although the application architecture, technologies and methodologies have gone though drastic changes.\nAPM 1.0 tools certainly cannot satisfy these needs. In the next blog, I will discuss how an APM 2.0 solution like BMC Application Management addresses the challenges with APM 1.0 products and help you manage applications better thus improving customer satisfaction and resulting in better bottomline.", "orig_sample_length": 882, "prompt_length": 682, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "that can be used by operations staff to monitor the application performance. Operations staff are not well-versed with APM tools and do not have deep-dive knowledge about the application.\nAPM 1.0 tools were built a decade ago to address challenges with .NET and Java application issues. Now the focus is on SaaS and mobile applications and they do not provide any support for these types of applications.\nAnother big problem with these tools is that they provide limited capabilities to report the application performance to the application owner. They do not provide the application owner with the bandwidth data to understand the end-user experience and they do not provide reporting on the application performance.\nMost APM tools do not provide the infrastructure owners with a complete picture of the application performance. They do not provide monitoring capabilities for infrastructure such as load balancers, ADNs, and databases.\nThey only provide the end-to-end application", "w_wm_output": "to monitor performance.\nAn APM 1.0 tool cannot provide both network level and deep-dive monitoring together. Most of the time these tools are installed as add-on to a network monitoring solution.\nThis is another major shortcoming of APM 1.0. When the performance monitoring is moved to deep-dive monitoring it is because the performance issue is assumed to be application server related. However most of the time it is the network performance that impacts user experience.\nEnterprise application performance is the sum of all the components that form application: DB, OS, middleware, network, storage that can become performance bottleneck.\nAPM 1.0 tools do have capabilities to monitor application performance but they are limited to monitoring databases, middleware, etc. However such monitoring is not required for real-user application performance.\nThere is a large number of components that can become performance bottleneck in enterprise application performance.\n",

Chuck Fleischmann next year will need deep pockets.\nTennessee's 3rd District Republican got a big jump-start on fundraising Friday during a private event at the Mountain City Club in Chattanooga.\nThe room was packed with monied supporters from across the 11-county district, and Fleischmann was joined by U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and 8th District U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn.\nWhen Fleischmann arrived, federal reports show his campaign had nearly $147,000 on hand. By the time he left, he had more than $500,000.\nThe Ooltewah lawyer raised more than $370,000 Friday afternoon alone.\nFor perspective, in 2013 and 2014 combined, Fleischmann raised a total of $1.6 million.\nThe purse was the biggest Fleischmann has ever collected at one time.\n\"This time, I am making sure we have the financial wherewithal early, so we can defend any primary challenge,\" Fleischmann said after the event. \"I'd prefer to have no primary challenger, but I'll be ready.\"\nFleischmann has never had an easy primary run in three elections to date.\nLast year, he eked out a win against then-27-year-old Republican challenger Weston Wamp, son of former Rep. Zach Wamp. Fleischmann won the race with 51 percent of the vote to Wamp's 49 percent.\nAnd in 2012, he battled the younger Wamp and Athens, Tenn., dairy icon Scotty Mayfield in the primary. Fleischmann got 39 percent of the vote, Mayfield got 31 percent and Wamp pulled 29 percent.\nHis first run in 2010 was a six-candidate scrum.\nMcCarthy said Friday the Tennessee Republican has been \"very effective\" for the 3rd District by getting funding for Oak Ridge National Laboratory and helping to move things along at the Chickamauga lock from his coveted spot on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen someone get on that [committee] faster than our own Chuck Fleischmann,\" he told the crowd.\nNo one has officially announced a campaign to", "baseline_completion": "challenge Fleischmann in the 2016 primary, but politicos have nodded toward state Sen.

But the omnipresent rating game has one big catch: ranking up is incredibly hard, while ranking down is rapid and easy, like a free-fall.Welcome to the reputation economy, where the individual social graph the social data set about each person determines one\u2019s value in society, access to services, and employability. In this economy, reputation becomes currency.\nOn the web or via mobile, we can now share almost anything. The reputation economy is based on the simplistic, but effective star ratings system.

{"idx": 412, "truncated_input": "President-elect Barack Obama\u2019s transition team held an hour and 15 minute meeting on Tuesday with just over a dozen social justice groups that presented what they see as the concerns of Catholics. In response, some Catholic bishops and commentators have told CNA that they don\u2019t believe these groups\u2019 concerns resonate with those of the Church.\nThe discussion between the Obama transition team and the different representatives touched on international development and trade, health care reform, reducing abortions, immigration, domestic policy and poverty reduction, and the environment.\nThe meeting of the 14 different organizations was organized by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and the lobbying group \u201cNetwork,\u201d which describes itself as \"a progressive voice within the Catholic community\" that lobbies Congress on justice and peace issues.\nSr. Simone Campbell, director of Network, told the National Catholic Reporter that the meeting was called to \"acknowledge the work that some of the Catholic groups had done in the Catholic community during the election and to begin to develop relationships for \u2018post-Jan. 20,\u2019 when the new administration takes over after Obama\u2019s inauguration.\"\nJames Salt, Organizing Director of Catholics United, explained to CNA that Catholics United participated in the meeting by highlighting \"key policies that are important to Catholics.\n\"Specifically we want the new administration to take seriously its commitment to reduce abortions in America. People of goodwill from both sides of the conversation can agree that 1 million abortions a year are 1 million abortions too many. We wanted to make sure that the Obama administration knew this was one of our highest priorities.\"\nYet, when Salt was asked if Catholics United planned to hold Obama accountable for his pledge to work to reduce abortions, he was cautious. \"We're hopeful that the Obama administration is with us on abortion reduction. We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\"\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \"many efforts underway and planned\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish\u2026the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\n\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation's 60 million Catholics,\" Wenski said.\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting\u2019s make up. \"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they're far less clever than I think they are. This strikes me as simply a pay-off to people who, from the Obama campaign's point of view, helped with the ground game in 2008.\"\nThe proof of the social justice groups\u2019 commitment to promoting Catholic concerns will be in \"how these \u2018Platform for the Common Good\u2019 folks help the rest of the Catholic Church defeat the Freedom of Choice Act and maintain the Bush administration's AIDS and malaria-reduction initiatives in Africa, which has helped millions more poor people than any of these groups has ever managed to do,\" Weigel explained to CNA.\nBishop of Madison Robert Morlino also added that the transition team must do more to dialogue with the Catholic Church. \"Recognizing the stark contrast between the positions on abortion of the President-elect and the teachings of the Catholic Church, it would be a mistake for the President-elect's transition team to pretend that this meeting satisfied his promise of dialoguing with the Catholic community,\" he said.\nThe bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, also weighed-in on the meeting by addressing what a Catholic organization should be emphasizing. He told CNA that \u201cBeing 'right' on any number of other issues will never outweigh the taking of human life through abortion. It would be my hope that any group calling themselves 'Catholic' would make this message abundantly clear, and express grave concern over the possibilities that the new administration may increase funding for abortions with public money or even erode conscience protections for Catholic hospitals and healthcare workers.\"\nFinally, Brian Burch, who heads a group of", "baseline_completion": "four lay Catholic organizations in the political, legal, research and educational fields, also expressed misgivings about the ability of the social justice consortium to rein in Obama\u2019s policies.\n\"We are pleased to hear that the Obama transition team is interested in talking with Catholics, but caution that such conversations must be weighed against his reported plans on abortion policy, including his Cabinet selections thus far. Specifically, we remain concerned that the new Administration is composed of leading abortion advocates who are preparing to overturn a large number of existing pro-life laws, while proving hundreds of millions of new taxpayer dollars for abortion.\n\"The fact that transition officials are consulting a select group of Catholic organizations who supported Obama's candidacy is not surprising. Whether these groups, some of whom claim to adhere to Catholic teaching, are able to hold him accountable on the issue of life, remains doubtful.\"", "orig_sample_length": 1375, "prompt_length": 1175, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "Catholic leaders who supported Sen.

Picture: Darren Pateman.\nMOTORISTS from Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast - who aren't familiar with the changes to driving conditions in Newcastle caused by the light rail system - would do well to take extra care around the city's CBD.\nOfficers from Police Transport Command, Traffic and Highway Patrol Command and Newcastle Police District have been regularly patrolling around the Hunter Street transport system since it went live on February 18.\nNorthern Region Traffic Tactician Chief Inspector Amanda Calder said officers have observed a number of dangerous incidents putting the lives of not only drivers at risk, but also bystanders and light rail commuters.\n\"The light rail has been up and running for more than a month and the vast majority of people are aware of the changed road network and have adapted to the changes,\" Chief Inspector Calder said.\n\"There are some drivers who are not paying attention and are making serious mistakes with their actions endangering themselves and others along Hunter Street and Stewart Avenue.\n\"Officers from Traffic and Highway Patrol have observed several near-misses during this first month of operation, with the most common offences being vehicles driving on the tram tracks; running red lights at light rail crossings; and pedestrians - who are often distracted and looking at their phones - jaywalking across the tracks.\"\nShe gave the example of one motorist who got it all wrong.\n\"One driver was seen by police to drive onto the rail track on Hunter Street, cross to the wrong side of the road, and drive into the path of an oncoming tram before proceeding through a red light before police could stop the car,\" Chief Inspector Calder said.\nThe Newcastle Transport website advises there are new signs, traffic lights and road markings across the city centre which show how drivers, cyclists and pedestrians should behave around light rail vehicles and tracks.\nMotorists are being urged to pay attention and follow the signage that spells out how to behave when sharing the roads with light rail vehicles. Picture: Marina Neil.\n\"A 40kph speed limit is in place for all vehicles, including light rail, on Hunter and Scott streets between Worth Place and Telford Street,\" the website said.\nFor most of Hunter and Scott streets", "baseline_completion": ", light rail runs in its own dedicated lane known as a tramway. Drivers are not allowed to drive on a tramway unless avoiding an obstruction.\nThere is also a mixed running section on Scott Street, between Newcomen and Pacific streets. In this section, light rail vehicles and other road users share a lane.\nRoad users are generally required to treat light rail as any other large vehicle in this section.\nPolice are encouraging motorists to use their common sense and take their time on the roads to adapt to the new road conditions.\n\"We're asking the community to not let these issues become long-term habits, be safe and alert at all times when near the light rail network,\" Chief Inspector Calder said.\nFor more information on the Newcastle Light Rail visit newcastletransport.info/light-rail.\nDiscuss \"Police spot risky driving habits around light rail vehicles\"", "orig_sample_length": 751, "prompt_length": 551, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": ", light rail vehicles are given priority over all other traffic, including buses.\n\"Under the NSW Road Rules, motorists must give way to light rail vehicles at traffic signals,\" the website said.\n\"As light rail has given way to all traffic, motorists must be prepared to stop at traffic signals.\n\"Light rail vehicles are not permitted to stop in the middle of a major road for more than five seconds, except to load or unload passengers or on request of a police officer or an emergency service worker.\"\nChief Inspector Calder said officers from the Newcastle Police District and Transport Command have been working together to educate motorists on the new road network.\n\"We are also working with the Newcastle Light Rail Authority to educate drivers and pedestrians on how to best share the road,\" she said.\n\"We are increasing our presence in the area while the light rail is operating, and will continue to do", "w_wm_output": ", there is a 35kph limit for all other roads in the area between Telford and Watt Streets.\nPedestrians and cyclists should also be aware of new road markings to ensure they are safe while travelling in the area.\nInspector Calder also warned pedestrians of their obligations.\nPedestrians should take care around the Hunter Street light rail. Picture: Marina Neil.\n\"It should be pointed out that motorists are not responsible for the actions of pedestrians who are crossing or attempting to cross the tram tracks; they are only required to operate in accordance with the directions given by traffic lights, signs, markings and road lines,\" she said.\n\"There are a large number of disruptive behaviours around the Hunter Street transport

More than 150 people were killed, some 100 women were raped and several hundred people were injured on September 28, 2009, as government troops attacked peaceful demonstrators.\nSince legal proceedings began in February 2010, close to 400 victims have been interviewed by the judges leading the case. But only eight people have been charged, though offenses were committed by scores of members of the armed forces, particularly the Red Berets. The military junta in power at the time of the massacre was headed by Moussa Dadis Camara.\nThere has been real progress in justice in recent months, the groups said. The establishment of a High Judicial Council in July, the ongoing improvement in the status of judges and the start of justice reform are all likely to help the judges complete their work.\nThere has been some progress in the legal case in recent weeks, including questioning of the director of Conakry stadium, the former Minister for Youth and Sport and, through an international rogatory commission, Dadis Camara, who has taken refuge in Burkina Faso.

On several occasions, despite repeated summonses, the judges have not been able to interview people summoned for questioning about the events of September 28, 2009.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC), which opened a preliminary examination on October 14, 2009, and which is continuing to monitor this case closely, has already alerted the national authorities to the need to conduct these proceedings within a reasonable time frame.", "orig_sample_length": 547, "prompt_length": 347, "baseline_completion_length": 200, "no_wm_output": "ims are now seriously ill and some have already died.\n\u201cThe perpetrators are now in power and the victims are languishing in the same conditions of extreme poverty as they were in 2009, before the massacre,\u201d said the groups.

As a Bengali with an MBBS degree, did you never feel the pressure to pursue a medical career?\nThere is always pressure on you while taking risks. Opposition from family and society is natural. I guess that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how the society reacts. But some of us are just not made to follow the societal norms. My immense love for music coupled with my adamant nature didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt let me settle for anything apart from music. For me, music is like medicine.\nDespite hailing from Kolkata, you never thought of composing for Bengali films.\nOf course I do. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd love to work with Srijit Mukherji and Kaushik Ganguly.\nHow much are you clued in to Bengali film music?\nI left Kolkata around eight years back and Bengali film music has come a long way since then. I love Anupamda\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds (Roy) songwriting and compositions. He is brilliant. The song Ek baar bol tor keu nei is one of my favourites.\nHeard you used to fight with your mother as a kid because you were forced to learn Rabindrasangeet?\nOh yes! Protidin ma er sanghe jhogra hotoh gaan sekha niye! But now Rabindrasangeet is my fave. There are times when I just sit quietly and listen to the songs. During my college days, I used to love rock. Fossils was at its peak then. I grew up listening to Kabir Suman, Anjan Dutt and so on.\nDo you catch up with your old friends whenever you come down to Kolkata?\nI do meet my school friends when I come here. Right now, Kolkata seems to be brimming with joy as Durga Puja is just weeks away. But sadly, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm going to miss it this time as I would be out of the country for work. What I will miss the most are pandal-hopping and eating out in the wee hours.\nAre you in touch with other Bengali music directors based in Mumbai?\nOf course. I have known Pritamda very well since I was nominated for my debut in Jism2 and for my second film, Yaariyan. I was lucky to score the soundtrack along with him, Mithoon and YoYo Honey Singh. We won the best music award for it too. Pritamda is very warm and often invites us over to his house. Jeetda (Gannguli) is like family to me. His wife is my mom\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds student and they are the sweetest people on earth. We often hang out in a group for adda where we don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt talk work. I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt know Shantanu Moitra personally, but whenever we meet he is extremely encouraging and supportive.\nHow is the competition in Mumbai music industry?\nQuite tough, but fair at the same time. What matters there is your song\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds merit and nothing else.\nMost of your songs, which are also penned by you, are hits. Does that create a pressure on you when you compose your next song?\nThere are certain expectations when you work with big stars and banners. But I take it more as a compliment than a burden.\nWell the list is endless -- my childhood, daily experiences, the people around, my lovers, travelling and imagination.\nWhile promoting Rustom in Kolkata, Akshay Kumar crooned Tere sang yaara, which is composed by you. How does it feel?\nFeels great. He told me that after a long time he has a favourite song. Akshay sir has always been very kind to me.
